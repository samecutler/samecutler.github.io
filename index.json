To study rapid quenching, we use rest- frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z~1.5. From spectral energy distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense starbursts prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with deep Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic observations for a subset of seven galaxies. Broad emission lines are detected for two galaxies and are most likely caused by AGN activity. The other five galaxies do not show any emission features, suggesting that gas has already been removed or depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more compact than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a central starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average transition time of 300 Myr for the rapid quenching phase. Approximately 4% of quiescent galaxies at z=1.5 have gone through rapid quenching; this fraction increases to 23% at z=2.2. We identify analogs in the TNG100 simulation and find that rapid quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGN, and for half of the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the starburst. We conclude that these massive quiescent galaxies are not just rapidly quenched but also rapidly formed through a major starburst. We speculate that mergers drive gas inflow towards the central regions and grow supermassive black holes, leading to rapid quenching by AGN feedback.","tags":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"Rapid Quenching of Galaxies at Cosmic Noon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam E.

With this rotation curve, we fit a dark matter density profile and determine the functional form of the profile (cusp or core). Predictions from comparing the shape of the rotation curve of CL2244-1 to that of M33 and other galaxies in the local universe suggest that the dark matter profile of CL2244-1 is best represented by a cuspy profile. Though this cuspy profile supports the cold dark matter cosmological model, we cannot rule out self-interacting dark matter, whose interactions may not have had time to shift the density profile to a core at such early times.","tags":null,"title":"Examining High Redshift Rotation Curves and Dark Matter Profiles Outside the Local Universe","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://samecutler.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
