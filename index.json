Together with existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available data set opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin^2 JWST footprint down to a 5σ limiting magnitude of~30 mag in 0.″32 apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point-spread function (PSF) of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intracluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a σ_NMAD ≈ 0.03 based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow up of some of the first JWST-selected samples in summer of 2023.","tags":["Catalogs","Abell clusters","Photometry","James Webb Space Telescope","Hubble Space Telescope","Astronomical methods","205","9","1234","2291","761","1043","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"The UNCOVER Survey: A First-look HST + JWST Catalog of 60,000 Galaxies near A2744 and beyond","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bingjie Wang","Joel Leja","Ivo Labbé","Rachel Bezanson","Katherine E.

With integration times of up to 16 hrs per band per galaxy, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity dispersions (σ_v), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line AGN, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent Hα emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint Hα, elevated [NII]/Hα suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses (M_dyn) by combining σ_v with structural parameters obtained from HST/COSMOS(-DASH), and compare them with stellar masses (M_*) derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between M_dyn/M_* and σ_v. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-σ_v galaxies being more bottom-heavy, was already in place at z∼2. When implementing the σ_v-dependent IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in M_dyn/M_* of 0.14 dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more complicated.","tags":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"The Heavy Metal Survey: Star Formation Constraints and Dynamical Masses of 21 Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z~1.4-2.2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vasily Kokorev","Seiji Fujimoto","Ivo Labbe","Jenny E.

In this work, we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the Hβ line with FWHM = 3439 ± 413 km s^-1, typical of the broad-line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of log_10(M_BH/M_⊙)=8.17± 0.42 and a bolometric luminosity of L_bol~6.6 × 10^45 erg s^-1. These values imply that our object is accreting at~40% of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of log_10(M_* /M_⊙) 8.7 , which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least~30%. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.","tags":["Active galactic nuclei","High-redshift galaxies","Early universe","16","734","435","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"UNCOVER: A NIRSpec Identification of a Broad-line AGN at z = 8.50","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bingjie Wang","Seiji Fujimoto","Ivo Labbé","Lukas J.

The galaxies are discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging and their distances are inferred with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, all from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey. Detailed stellar population modeling using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data corroborates the primeval characteristics of these galaxies: low mass (~10^8 M_⊙), young, rapidly assembling, metal-poor, and star-forming. Interestingly, both galaxies are spatially resolved, having lensing-corrected rest-UV effective radii on the order of 300-400 pc, which are notably larger than other spectroscopically confirmed systems at similar redshifts. The observed dynamic range of z ≳ 10 sizes spans over 1 order of magnitude, implying a significant scatter in the size-mass relation at early times.

In a companion paper, we apply theProspector Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broad-band photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), non-universal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2–5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR; and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ∼ 0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over short time scale and ∼ 0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ∼ 0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.","tags":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"Quantifying the Effects of Known Unknowns on Inferred High-redshift Galaxy Properties: Burstiness, the IMF, and Nebular Physics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sedona H.

In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4um) structures of 11 sub-millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at z~0.9-3.5 that are fainter than bright “classical” sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all exhibit decreasing sizes and increasing central concentration towards longer wavelengths. The smaller sizes of these objects at long wavelengths indicate that their stellar mass profiles are more compact than their optical light profiles, likely due to centrally-concentrated dust obscuration. Further, we find that galaxies with higher central concentration values tend to have more extreme size ratios (comparing the rest-frame NIR to rest-frame optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust distributions. We also find the galaxies with the most extreme size ratios do not have elevated 1.2mm flux densities compared to the rest of our sample: we argue this means compact dust geometry, rather than e.g. high total dust quantity, drives the most extreme observed rest-frame NIR-to-optical size ratios. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative sub-mm population.","tags":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"UNCOVER: The rest ultraviolet to near infrared multiwavelength structures and dust distributions of sub-millimeter-detected galaxies in Abell 2744","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Weaver","Sam Cutler"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705515266,"objectID":"be18d663f967ae593db59fdeafadc62c","permalink":"https://samecutler.github.io/publication/weaver-2023/","publishdate":"2024-01-17T18:30:12.915122Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weaver-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"astrowhit/aperpy: v1.0.1","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seiji Fujimoto","Rachel Bezanson","Ivo Labbe","Gabriel Brammer","Sedona H.

DUALZ features a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of μ\u003e2 down to a sensitivity of σ=32.7 μJy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N rsim5.0 with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_1.2mm^int=0.24. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 μm line emitter at z=6.3254±0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W\u003e27mag, F150W-F444W\u003e2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W\u003e30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z_spec=10.07, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z∼10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.","tags":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"title":"DUALZ: Deep UNCOVER-ALMA Legacy High-Z Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junkai Zhang","Stijn Wuyts","Sam E.

From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60% show definitive evidence for broad-line Hα with FWHM\u003e2000 km/s, for 20% current data are inconclusive, and 20% are brown dwarf stars.

Remarkably, among all z_phot\u003e5 galaxies with F277W-F444W\u003e1 in UNCOVER at least 33% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80% AGN for sources with F277W-F444W\u003e1.6.

While their UV-luminosities (-16\u003eM_UV\u003e-20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 10^7-10^9 M_⊙ black holes radiating at ∼ 10-40% of Eddington. The number densities are surprisingly high at ∼10^-5 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ∼1% of the UV-selected galaxies.

Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 ± 0.002. We find that the NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z ≈ 10 galaxies, characterized primarily by star formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric estimates ( M_⋆∼1.4_-0.4^+0.3×10^8 M_⊙). Given the predicted BH mass (M_BH~10^7-10^8 M_⊙), the resulting ratio of M_BH/M_⋆ remains 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus lending support to the heavy seeding channel for the formation of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.","tags":["Active galactic nuclei","Early universe","High-redshift galaxies","16","435","734","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"title":"UNCOVER: The Growth of the First Massive Black Holes from JWST/NIRSpec-Spectroscopic Redshift Confirmation of an X-Ray Luminous AGN at z = 10.1","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas J.

One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (Furtak et al. 2023), allowing an unprecedented detailed look into this enigmatic population. Here we present deep spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened (A_V∼3) broad emission-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at a redshift of z_spec=7.0451±0.0005. From the width of Hβ (FWHM=2800±250 km/s) we derive a black hole mass of M_BH=3_-1^+2×10^7 M_⊙. We infer a very high ratio of black hole to galaxy mass of at least 3% and possibly as high as 100%, an order of magnitude or more than is seen in local galaxies. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (L_bol=(1.1±0.3)×10^45 erg/ athrms) suggest that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit. Based on early JWST imaging studies we estimate that such heavily reddened, low-mass black holes can be ∼100 times more common than UV-selected ones at this epoch. The rapid growth and high black hole to galaxy mass ratio of A2744-QSO1 suggests that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds (Inayoshi et al. 2020; Greene et al. 2020; Volonteri 2021) and the first luminous quasars (Fan et al. 2023).","tags":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"A supermassive black hole in the early universe growing in the shadows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hakim Atek","Ivo Labbé","Lukas J.

However, these galaxies have eluded comprehensive spectroscopic studies owing to their extreme faintness. Here we report the first spectroscopic analysis of 8 ultra-faint galaxies during the epoch of reionization with absolute magnitudes between M_UV ∼ -17 to -15 mag (down to 0.005 L^⋆). The combination of ultra-deep NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) observations and the strong gravitational lensing boost of Abell~2744 allow us to derive the first spectroscopic constraints on the prevalence of faint galaxies and their ionizing properties during the Universe's first billion years. We find that faint galaxies are prodigious producers of ionizing photons with log(ξ_ion/ Hz erg^-1) =25.8± 0.05, a factor of 4 larger than canonical values. This means that the total rate of ionizing photons produced by galaxies exceeds that needed for reionization, even for modest values of escape fraction (f_esc =5%).

To study rapid quenching, we use rest-frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z~1.5. From spectral energy distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense starbursts prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with deep Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic observations for a subset of seven galaxies. Broad emission lines are detected for two galaxies, and are most likely caused by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. The other five galaxies do not show any emission features, suggesting that gas has already been removed or depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more compact than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a central starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average transition time of 300 Myr for the rapid quenching phase. Approximately 4% of quiescent galaxies at z = 1.5 have gone through rapid quenching; this fraction increases to 23% at z = 2.2. We identify analogs in the TNG100 simulation and find that rapid quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGNs, and for half of the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the starburst. We conclude that these young massive quiescent galaxies are not just rapidly quenched, but also rapidly formed through a major starburst. We speculate that mergers drive gas inflow toward the central regions and grow supermassive black holes, leading to rapid quenching by AGN feedback.","tags":["Galaxy formation","Galaxy evolution","Galaxy quenching","595","594","2040","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"Rapid Quenching of Galaxies at Cosmic Noon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seiji Fujimoto","Bingjie Wang","John Weaver","Vasily Kokorev","Hakim Atek","Rachel Bezanson","Ivo Labbe","Gabriel Brammer","Jenny E.

We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100% for z\u003e9 candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Lyα break alone with prism can be as large as ±0.2, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources. With spec-z confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at z≃9-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) Hβ, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at z≃ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at z∼6 and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of z\u003e9 galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at z=8.50 with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane.

Ultradeep, low-resolution 1-5 μm spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to near-infrared spectral standards infers spectral classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8-T9. The spectrum of the warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and a fit to atmosphere models indicates Teff = 1300 K and [M/H]~-1.0, making this one of the few examples of a spectroscopically-confirmed T subdwarf. The spectrum of the coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, places it near the T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and we identify features of CH_4, CO, H_2O, and likely PH_3 in the 3.5-5.0 μm band. Our analysis suggests that PH3 is favored over CO_2 in this source, a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9-4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, and population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk or halo.

Photometry is decomposed into a central and an outer spatial component using observed z_F850LP - H_F160W colors. The PROSPECTOR code is used to model spectral energy distributions for the center, outskirt, and integrated galaxy using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based photometry, with additional constraints on gas-phase metallicity and spectroscopic redshift from MOSDEF spectroscopy. For the low-resolution bands, spatially resolved photometry is determined with an iterative approach. The reconstructed SFHs indicate that the majority of galaxies with log(M_⋆/M_⊙) 10.5 are observed while their central regions undergo relatively recent (\u003c100 Myr) bursts of star formation, whereas the outskirts have a smooth, quasi-steady SFH that gently increases toward the redshift of observation. The enhanced star formation activity of the central parts is broadly consistent with the idea that it is produced by highly dissipative gas compaction and accretion. The wide range of central densities and sizes observed in the sample suggests that, for the selected galaxies, such a process has started but is still far from being completed. The implication would be that selecting star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon frequently includes systems in an “evolved” evolutionary phase where the centers have recently started a burst of star formation activity that will likely initiate inside-out quenching in the next several hundred million years.","tags":["Galaxy evolution","Galaxy formation","Spectral energy distribution","594","595","2129","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"The Differential Assembly History of the Centers and Outskirts of Main-sequence Galaxies at z   2.3","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Cutler","Katherine Whitaker","Mauro Giavalisco","Zhiyuan Ji","Yingjie Cheng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705515269,"objectID":"50da5c421712235b97c7701c6ee55573","permalink":"https://samecutler.github.io/publication/cutler-2023-d/","publishdate":"2024-01-17T18:30:15.365633Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cutler-2023-d/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the history of star formation in galaxies is key to gaining a more comprehensive picture of galaxy formation, evolution, and quenching.

Semi-resolved SFHs also require the photometry and spectroscopy to be spatially resolved, which limits the use of longer-wavelength data. We present a study of the semi-resolved, 2-component SFHs of 60 z~2 main-sequence, star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-N field, modeled using the Prospector code with a novel iterative method to incorporate unresolved K-band/IRAC data.

Due to the extensive data sets required to model resolved SFHs, we also develop a model to match observed F814W-F160W color gradients from 3D-DASH and COSMOS/ACS imaging to quenching and formation timescales of quenched galaxies at z~2. These timescales provide an overview of the galaxies' formation time (early or late) and quenching speed (fast or slow), suggesting that the overall evolutionary history of these quenched galaxies at this epoch can be inferred using semi-revolved color gradients.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring Star-Formation Histories at z 2 with a Semi-Resolved Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rachel Bezanson","Ivo Labbe","Katherine E.

Using VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopy, we perform a 2D spectral analysis of the H-alpha emission. With this rotation curve, we fit a dark matter density profile and determine the functional form of the profile (cusp or core). Predictions from comparing the shape of the rotation curve of CL2244-1 to that of M33 and other galaxies in the local universe suggest that the dark matter profile of CL2244-1 is best represented by a cuspy profile. Though this cuspy profile supports the cold dark matter cosmological model, we cannot rule out self-interacting dark matter, whose interactions may not have had time to shift the density profile to a core at such early times.","tags":[],"title":"Examining High Redshift Rotation Curves and Dark Matter Profiles Outside the Local Universe","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://samecutler.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The JWST PRIMER Treasury survey is a\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"28b5642c08b6498102b23394ab61273f","permalink":"https://samecutler.github.io/project/primer/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/primer/","section":"project","summary":"JWST/NIRCam photometric catalogs of the COSMOS and UDS blank fields","tags":["Catalogs","Featured"],"title":"PRIMER","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Several previous HST-based studies (including Cutler et al. 2022) have found a flattening of sizes at the low-mass end of the quiescent size-mass relation.

A sample of 332 7\u0026lt;logM\u0026lt;11 galaxies are selected using UVJ and sSFR criteria and modeled in both F150W and F444W using (GALFIT)[https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html].
