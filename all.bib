        Cosmic Noon (1<z<3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury
        surveys, which highlight two distinct classes of quiescent
        galaxies. While the massive population is well studied at these
        redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously under-explored
        due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient
        sensitivity and spatial resolution (in the rest-frame near-IR).
        We select a conservative sample of robust low-mass quiescent
        galaxy candidates using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star
        formation rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both
        rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-
        infrared (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous ``flattening'' of
        the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation, which results from
        the separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct
        populations at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim10.3$: low-mass
        quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and have disky
        structures, and massive galaxies with prolate morphologies and
        older median stellar ages. These separate populations imply mass
        quenching dominates at the massive end while other mechanisms,
        such as environmental or feedback-driven quenching, form the
        low-mass end. This stellar mass dependent slope of the quiescent
        size-mass relation could also indicate a shift from size growth
        due to star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers
        (massive galaxies). The transition mass between these two
        populations also corresponds with other dramatic changes in
        galaxy evolutions (e.g. star-formation efficiency, dust
        obscuration, and stellar-halo mass ratios), further highlighting
        the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy
        formation.}",

        NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before the epoch of

        NIRCam imaging of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 over
        $\sim 45$ arcmin$^{2}$ down to $\sim 29.5$ AB mag. Here, we
        present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived
        through lensing clusters at $9<z<12$. Using comprehensive end-
        to-end simulations, we account for all lensing effects and
        systematic uncertainties in deriving both the amplification
        factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confirm the
        intriguing excess of UV-bright galaxies ($M_{UV} < -20$ AB mag)
        previously reported at $z>9$ in recent JWST studies. In
        particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes better the
        bright-end of the luminosity function compared to the classical
        Schechter form. The number density of these bright galaxies is
        10-100 times larger than theoretical predictions and previous
        findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations.
        Additionally, we measure a star formation rate density of
        $\rho_{\rm SFR} = 10^{-2.64}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$
        at these redshifts, which is 4 to 10 times higher than galaxy
        formation models that assume a constant star formation
        efficiency. Future wide-area surveys and accurate modeling of

        gravitational lensing over a wide area, the galaxy cluster field
        A2744 is ideal for searching for the earliest galaxies. Here we

        survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying
        a clear broad-line component as inferred from the

        galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further
        supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines,
        and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of

        Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the

        magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with
        recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding
        suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black
        holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a
        super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted

        integration times of up to 16 hrs per band per galaxy, we
        observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in
        atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic
        redshifts for all 21 galaxies and for 19 we also measure stellar
        velocity dispersions ($\sigma_v$), ages, and elemental
        abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one
        emission-line AGN, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent
        through their faint or absent H$\alpha$ emission and evolved
        stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint H$\alpha$,
        elevated [NII]/H$\alpha$ suggests a non-star-forming origin. We
        calculate dynamical masses ($M_{\rm dyn}$) by combining

        HST/COSMOS(-DASH), and compare them with stellar masses ($M_*$)
        derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various

        This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with
        high-$\sigma_v$ galaxies being more bottom-heavy, was already in
        place at $z\sim2$. When implementing the $\sigma_v$-dependent
        IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and
        correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements,
        we find a low scatter in $M_{\rm dyn}/M_*$ of 0.14 dex. However,
        these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which
        exceed the dynamical masses by 34\%. This tension suggests that
        distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into
        today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more
        complicated.}",

        through the public CEERS Early Release Science (ERS) program and
        imcascade, an astronomical fitting code that utilizes Multi-
        Gaussian Expansion, to carry out our size measurements. When
        compared to the extrapolation of rest-optical size-mass
        relations for quiescent galaxies at lower redshift, eight out of
        ten candidates in our sample (80\%) are on average more compact
        by {\ensuremath{\sim}}40\%. Seven out of ten candidates (70\%)
        exhibit rest-frame infrared sizes {\ensuremath{\sim}}10\%
        smaller than rest-frame optical sizes, indicative of negative
        color gradients. Two candidates (20\%) have rest-frame infrared
        sizes {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.4{\texttimes} larger than rest-frame
        optical sizes; one of these candidates exhibits signs of ongoing
        or residual star formation, suggesting this galaxy may not be
        fully quenched. The remaining candidate is unresolved in both
        filters, which may indicate an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

        suggests that the size evolution of quiescent galaxies is
        steeper than previously anticipated and our current

        leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744

        millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at

        reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all exhibit
        decreasing sizes and increasing central concentration towards

        wavelengths indicate that their stellar mass profiles are more
        compact than their optical light profiles, likely due to
        centrally-concentrated dust obscuration. Further, we find that
        galaxies with higher central concentration values tend to have
        more extreme size ratios (comparing the rest-frame NIR to rest-

        geometry, rather than e.g. high total dust quantity, drives the
        most extreme observed rest-frame NIR-to-optical size ratios.

        models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-

        \textbackslashtexttt\{Prospector\} Bayesian framework to jointly
        infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from
        broad-band photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we
        present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy
        distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have
        photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic
        shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar
        mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices
        encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation
        history (SFH), non-universal stellar initial mass functions
        (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas
        density and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts
        the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the
        systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2--5 times
        larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR;
        and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different
        SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of
        the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common
        practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-
        fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively
        underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly
        stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the
        formal uncertainties, and introduce $\sim 0.8$ dex systematics
        in SFR averaged over short time scale and $\sim 0.3$ dex
        systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible
        nebular emission model causes $\sim 0.2$ dex systematic increase
        in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This
        paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty
        estimate in SED modeling.}",

        Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new

        deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury
        program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact,
        with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes

        F277W$-$F444W$>1.6$. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of
        $10^7-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. While their UV-luminosities

        AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN
        light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred
        bolometric luminosities are typical of $10^7-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$
        black holes radiating at $\sim 10-40\%$ of Eddington. The number
        densities are surprisingly high at $\sim10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$
        mag$^{-1}$, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected
        quasars, while accounting for $\sim1\%$ of the UV-selected
        galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not
        contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses
        challenges to models of black hole growth.}",

     abstract = "{The existence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift seems to
        require rapid quenching, but it is unclear whether all quiescent
        galaxies have gone through this phase and what physical
        mechanisms are involved. To study rapid quenching, we use rest-
        frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.5. From spectral energy
        distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense
        starbursts prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with deep
        Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic observations for a subset of seven
        galaxies. Broad emission lines are detected for two galaxies,
        and are most likely caused by active galactic nucleus (AGN)
        activity. The other five galaxies do not show any emission
        features, suggesting that gas has already been removed or
        depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more compact
        than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a central
        starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average transition
        time of 300 Myr for the rapid quenching phase. Approximately 4\%
        of quiescent galaxies at z = 1.5 have gone through rapid
        quenching; this fraction increases to 23\% at z = 2.2. We
        identify analogs in the TNG100 simulation and find that rapid
        quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGNs, and for half of
        the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the starburst.
        We conclude that these young massive quiescent galaxies are not
        just rapidly quenched, but also rapidly formed through a major
        starburst. We speculate that mergers drive gas inflow toward the
        central regions and grow supermassive black holes, leading to
        rapid quenching by AGN feedback.}",

        intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that
        was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing galaxy
        cluster Abell 2744 (Furtak et al. 2023), allowing an
        unprecedented detailed look into this enigmatic population. Here
        we present deep spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec observations of this
        object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three
        images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened
        ($A_V\sim3$) broad emission-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)
        at a redshift of $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=7.0451\pm0.0005$. From the

        on early JWST imaging studies we estimate that such heavily
        reddened, low-mass black holes can be $\sim100$ times more
        common than UV-selected ones at this epoch. The rapid growth and
        high black hole to galaxy mass ratio of A2744-QSO1 suggests that
