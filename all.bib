        Webb Space Telescope data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience
        surveys targeting the lensing cluster A2744, we present
        multiband morphological measurements for a sample of 995
        galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using
        NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of 4 < z < 8.
        The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic
        by simultaneously modeling the images in six NIRCam wide filters
        covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling
        technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50\%.
        Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of S{\'e}rsic indices,
        with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology.
        We model the size{\textendash}mass relation in a Bayesian manner
        using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution
        while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the
        average size of galaxies at logM*/M{\ensuremath{\odot}}=8.5
        grows rapidly, from 400 pc at z = 8 to 830 pc at z = 4. This is
        faster evolution than expected from power-law scalings of the
        Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous
        results at z < 2. This suggests that different and/or much
        stronger processes affect low-mass systems during the epoch of
        reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter
        (0.23 dex) are nonevolving. We discuss the remarkable
        consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the

        ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected

        samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-
        selected sample are morphologically distinct from other

        wavelength gradient from 1.5-4.4$μ$m, with a more dramatic
        decrease in size towards longer wavelengths. While the rest-NIR
        surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are
        brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming

        dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming
        galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-
        obscured core, leading to extended and clumpy morphologies at
        rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in the rest-
        NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already

        objects at high redshifts dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs),
        which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be
        dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some of their other
        features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as
        prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing
        metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including
        in deep stacks. Time variability is another robust test of AGN
        activity. Here, we exploit the z = 7.045 multiply imaged LRD
        A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of
        variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three
        images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate
        its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the
        equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and
        H{\ensuremath{\beta}} lines, which are independent of
        magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant
        variations, of up to 18 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3\% for
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and up to 22 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 8\% in
        H{\ensuremath{\beta}}, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the
        rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We
        find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting
        systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined
        whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum
        variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped
        random walk variability model for an AGN such as A2744-QSO1
        (M$_{BH}$ = 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) given the sparse sampling of the
        light curve with the available data. Our results therefore
        support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the

        unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass galaxies
        ($M_\star < 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$) at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$),
        uniformly selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric

        the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-
        mass galaxies -- has long been proposed as the primary driver to
        establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters
        at low redshift ($z<1$). However, we still do not know whether
        these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at
        higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to
        fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained
        unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James

        mass regime (8.5$<$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$11.0) are
        indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic
        noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field.

        overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to
        explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale
        quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the
        intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster
        galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing
        the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass
        quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at $z<0.5$. Using
        spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience
        programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent
        size-mass relation between $7<\log(M_\star/M_\odot)<10$ using
        JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1531 galaxies in the
        $z=0.308$ Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass
        relation has a significantly higher scatter than similar-
        redshift field samples, despite comparable best-fit relations in
        both the dwarf and intermediate-mass regimes. Both ``progenitor
        bias'', where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the
        cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy
        structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This
        evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative
        evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster
        are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for
        our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs
        relatively late, at $z<1.5$. In this scenario, the progenitor
        population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic
        noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves
        ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and
        drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-
        quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the

        difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in
        these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and
        existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel
        imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and
        $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR
        luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at
        $\lambda_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ \mu$m imply flat slopes in the
        rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($Trsim500$ K) dust.
        Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold
        ($T\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these
        observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission
        of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a
        mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our
        [$\mathrm{C}_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty
        starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that
        both LRDs must have $\log(L_\mathrm{IR}/L_\odot) \lesssim 12.2$
        at the $3\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the
        predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they
        galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs
        are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust
        temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current
        observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder
        LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust
        attenuation.}",

        followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study
        of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs
        remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM
        spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the
        UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and
        broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to
        explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar
        contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a
        post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a
        reddened AGN being subdominant at all wavelengths and
        contributing at a level of {\ensuremath{\sim}}20\%. However,
        this model infers a stellar mass of M$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ within a radius of r$_{e}$ < 30 pc,
        driving its central density to the highest among observations to
        date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO1
        is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical
        galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel.
        The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction
        law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness
        may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also
        probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of
        A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation
        mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN
        contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations
        could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs. *The error code

        billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent
        observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies
        would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars.
        An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of
        massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars.
        However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies
        have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of
        photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic
        confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the
        quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z = 4.90, 1.2
        billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption

        short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star
        formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According

        stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to
        plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with
        JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that

        Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and
        JWST/Hubble Space Telescope coverage in A2744 to study the
        multiwavelength (0.5‑4.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) structures of 11
        submillimeter detected galaxies at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.9‑3.5
        that are fainter than bright ``classical'' submillimeter
        galaxies, seven of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While
        these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all
        are smaller and more concentrated toward longer wavelengths. Of
        the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for
        appreciable active galactic nucleus (AGN) flux contributions (at
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m). Excluding the two
        AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long-wavelength sizes
        indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to
        trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their
        optical profiles. The submillimeter detections and visible dust
        lanes suggest that centrally concentrated dust is a key driver
        of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more
        concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame
        NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most
        compact light distributions also have the most concentrated
        dust. The 1.2 mm flux densities and size ratios of these nine
        objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry
        impact these galaxies' multiwavelength structures. Upcoming

        massive quenched galaxies, suggesting that the formation and
        quenching pathways of low and high mass galaxies are different.
        Owing to random viewing angles, a galaxy can have a range of

        therefore necessary to consider the full distribution of axis
        ratios at a population level. Using JWST/NIRCam rest-optical

        considering pure populations (thin/thick disk, prolate,

        Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and
        NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER)
        in the lensing field A2744, we report the identification of a
        sample of little red dots at 3 < z $_{phot}$ < 7 that likely
        contain highly reddened accreting supermassive black holes.

        in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy
        distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models
        with hot dust rather than obscured star formation to reproduce
        the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm nondetections. While
        compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the

     abstract = "{Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the
        Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation
        and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of
        ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity
        degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar
        systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at
        $z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell
        2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two
        low-mass companions. Using deep data from the
        UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed
        in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $\sim2$ Gyr,
        suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z\sim10$. While
        the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent
        with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse
        host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative
        $\sim2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the
        past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low
        inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age
        clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of
        star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The
        cluster masses are high, $\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}$, which may
        explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-
        merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with
        being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This
        unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-
        lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations,
        offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the
        broader processes of galaxy assembly.}",

        radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455
        quiescent galaxies with log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$>10$, whereas half-
        mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the

        used to measure $r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$, also separating the

        suggests a plausible cause of the high abundance of z > 9

        One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a
        broad-line AGN at z = 8.50 with a physical separation of 380 kpc

        enclosing them with a radius of 7.69 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.18

        between 0.5 < z < 3 by tracing the number density and structural
        evolution of a sample of 4518 old and 583 young quiescent
        galaxies with log(M $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$/M
        $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) > 10.4, selected from the COSMOS2020
        catalog with complementary Hubble Space Telescope F160W imaging
        from the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2, roughly 50\% are recently quenched
        galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly
        rare toward lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak
        epoch of massive galaxy quenching occurred at z > 2. Our data
        show that while the effective half-light radius of quiescent
        galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies
        are significantly smaller than their older counterparts at the
        same redshift. In this work we investigate the connection
        between this size difference and other structural properties,
        including axis ratio, color gradients, stellar mass, and the
        intrinsic scatter in effective radius. We demonstrate that the
        size difference is driven by the most massive subpopulation
        (log(M $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$/M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) >
        11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to
        intermediate-mass galaxies (10.4 < log(M
        $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$/M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) < 11).
        Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical size shows a
        strong coevolution over the investigated time period and peaks
        around z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2 for both populations, only
        diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and assuming we are not
        missing a significant population of lower surface brightness
        galaxies, while the formation and quenching mechanisms that
        dominate at higher redshifts yield compact remnants, multiple
        evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies of
        galaxies that quench at z < 1.}",

        of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well
        studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously
        underexplored due to a lack of observing facilities with
        sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution. We select a
        conservative sample of low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates
        using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate
        criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame
        UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared
        (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous flattening of the low-mass
        quiescent size{\textendash}mass relation, which results from the
        separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct
        populations at $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim
        10.3$ : low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and
        have disky structures, and massive galaxies consistent with
        spheroidal morphologies and older median stellar ages. These
        separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the
        massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or
        feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar
        mass-dependent slope of the quiescent size{\textendash}mass
        relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to
        star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive
        galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations
        also corresponds with other dramatic changes and characteristic
        masses in several galaxy evolution scaling relations (e.g., star
        formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-to-halo mass
        ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-

        galaxies at 1.3 < z < 2.3 with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With
        integration times of up to 16 hr per band per galaxy, we observe
        numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric
        windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all
        21 galaxies, and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity
        dispersions ({\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$), ages, and
        elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper.
        Except for one emission-line active galactic nucleus, all
        galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or
        absent H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and evolved stellar
        spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, elevated [N II]/H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical

        with structural parameters obtained from the Hubble Space
        Telescope COSMOS(-DASH) survey and compare them with stellar
        masses (M $_{*}$) derived using spectrophotometric modeling,

        function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between M

        correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with
        high-{\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$ galaxies being more bottom
        heavy, was already in place at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2. When
        implementing the {\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$-dependent IMF
        found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting
        for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a
        low scatter in M $_{dyn}$/M $_{*}$ of 0.14 dex. However, these
        assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed
        the dynamical masses by 34\%. This tension suggests that distant
        quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today's
        massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more
        complicated.}",

        or residual star formation, suggesting this galaxy may not be
        fully quenched. The remaining candidate is unresolved in both

        models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-

        Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar
        population properties from broadband photometry as part of the
        UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in
        spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample
        selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we
        quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model
        choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and
        age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in
        the star formation history (SFH), nonuniversal stellar initial
        mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular
        abundances, gas density, and ionizing photon budget. We find
        that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred
        properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1
        dex, 2{\textendash}5 times larger than the formal reported
        uncertainties in mass and SFR, and importantly, exceed the
        scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although
        the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy,
        our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of
        assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing
        multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true
        systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the
        inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and
        introduce {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged
        over a short timescale and {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.3 dex
        systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible
        nebular emission model causes {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 dex
        systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal
        uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a
        complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.}",

        transition from neutral hydrogen to ionized plasma around
        600-800 Myr after the Big Bang$^{1-3}$, has been a matter of
        debate$^{4}$. Some models suggest that high ionizing emissivity
        and escape fractions (f$_{esc}$) from quasars support their role
        in driving cosmic reionization$^{5,6}$. Others propose that the
        high f$_{esc}$ values from bright galaxies generate sufficient

        efficiency and f$_{esc}$, can effectively dominate cosmic

        spectroscopic studies of low-mass galaxies have not been done

        erg$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$)] = 25.80 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.14, a

        revealed an emerging population of red pointlike sources that
        could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black
        hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work, we present a
        JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury
        survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying
        a clear broad-line component as inferred from the
        H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line with FWHM = 3439 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        413 km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad-line region of an active
        galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further
        supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines,
        and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of
        ${\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot })=8.17\pm
        0.42$ and a bolometric luminosity of L $_{bol}$
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.6 {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$
        erg s$^{-1}$. These values imply that our object is accreting at
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40\% of the Eddington limit.
        Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the
        optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA,
        indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of
        ${\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }) 8.7$ , which would
        lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at
        least \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\%. This is orders of
        magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with
        recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding
        suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black
        holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a
        super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted
        number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec
        observations of larger samples will allow us to further
        investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.}",

        Bogdan et al. reported the detection of an X-ray luminous
        supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z > 10.
        Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new
        insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short
        time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the
        exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the

        star formation features. We see no clear evidence of the

        with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We
        perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new
        NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The
        fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for the host galaxy that is

        2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus

        galaxies have gone through this phase and what physical
        mechanisms are involved. To study rapid quenching, we use rest-
        frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.5. From spectral energy
        distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense
        starbursts prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with deep
        Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic observations for a subset of seven
        galaxies. Broad emission lines are detected for two galaxies,
        and are most likely caused by active galactic nucleus (AGN)
        activity. The other five galaxies do not show any emission
        features, suggesting that gas has already been removed or
        depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more compact
        than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a central
        starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average transition
        time of 300 Myr for the rapid quenching phase. Approximately 4\%
        of quiescent galaxies at z = 1.5 have gone through rapid
        quenching; this fraction increases to 23\% at z = 2.2. We
        identify analogs in the TNG100 simulation and find that rapid
        quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGNs, and for half of
        the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the starburst.
        We conclude that these young massive quiescent galaxies are not
        just rapidly quenched, but also rapidly formed through a major
        starburst. We speculate that mergers drive gas inflow toward the
        central regions and grow supermassive black holes, leading to
        rapid quenching by AGN feedback.}",

        The PROSPECTOR code is used to model spectral energy
        distributions for the center, outskirt, and integrated galaxy
        using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and

        highly dissipative gas compaction and accretion. The wide range
        of central densities and sizes observed in the sample suggests
        that, for the selected galaxies, such a process has started but

        the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in
        general, sizes and S{\'e}rsic indices of typical galaxies are
        accurate to limiting magnitudes of H $_{160}$ < 23 and H
        $_{160}$ < 22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space,
        galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological
        measurements out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2 and
        down to $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim 9$ . With
        the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a
        flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below
        $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim 10.5$ that persists
        out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2. We show that
        environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at
        least out to z = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may
        instead govern the structural evolution.}",

     abstract = "{We present a F160W morphological catalog for the COSMOS-DASH survey, the
        largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing
        the ``Drift And SHift'' (DASH) observing technique for NIR
        imaging, in which guide star acquisition is only done once per
        orbit and instrument drift is corrected in post processing, the
        COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.7 square degrees of
        the UltraVISTA deep stripes. Global structural parameters are
        measured for about 50,000 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using
        GALFIT, with detection using a deep combined optical and near-
        infrared noise-equalized HST image. While the shallower depth of
        DASH observations and the non-standard data reduction techniques
        may not be ideal for low-mass or extended galaxies, we recover
        consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST
        morphological catalogs out to z=2 and
        log(M/Msun)\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10. As the DASH
        technique limits each pointing to an exposure time of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde300 seconds, the corresponding
        images are shallower than usual HST NIR imaging with 5-sigma
        depths of 25.1 ABmag. Here we test the parameter space where
        morphological fits of DASH galaxies are robustly recovered. In
        general, sizes and S{\'e}rsic indices of typical galaxies are
        accurately obtained for H(160)<23 and H(160)<22. In size-mass
        parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust
        morphologies in general below redshift 2 and log(M/Msun)>9. At
        log(M/Msun)<10.5, we find a flattening of the quiescent size-
        mass relation, implying the sizes of low mass quiescent galaxies
        are more similar to star-forming galaxies with a similar
        redshift and mass. Trends with axis-ratio and environment
        suggest that low mass galaxies that quench as satellites may
        retain morphologies comparable to similar mass star-forming
        galaxies.}",

        rotation curve for a distant gravitationally-lensed massive,
        dusty star-forming galaxy, CL2244-1, with a spectroscopic
        redshift 1.77. Using VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopy, we perform a 2D

        functional form of the profile (cusp or core). Predictions from

        M33 and other galaxies in the local universe suggest that the
        dark matter profile of CL2244-1 is best represented by a cuspy
        profile. Though this cuspy profile supports the cold dark matter
        cosmological model, we cannot rule out self-interacting dark
