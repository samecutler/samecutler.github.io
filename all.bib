        relation at cosmic noon (1 < z < 3) from the JWST PRIMER and
        UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlights two distinct classes
        of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well
        studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously
        underexplored due to a lack of observing facilities with
        sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution. We select a
        conservative sample of low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates
        using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate
        criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame
        UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared
        (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous flattening of the low-mass
        quiescent size{\textendash}mass relation, which results from the
        separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct
        populations at $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim
        10.3$ : low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and
        have disky structures, and massive galaxies consistent with
        spheroidal morphologies and older median stellar ages. These
        separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the
        massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or
        feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar
        mass-dependent slope of the quiescent size{\textendash}mass
        relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to
        star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive
        galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations
        also corresponds with other dramatic changes and characteristic
        masses in several galaxy evolution scaling relations (e.g., star
        formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-to-halo mass
        ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-
        mass and massive galaxy formation.}",

        ultradeep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent
        galaxies at 1.3 < z < 2.3 with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With
        integration times of up to 16 hr per band per galaxy, we observe
        numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric
        windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all
        21 galaxies, and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity
        dispersions ({\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$), ages, and
        elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper.
        Except for one emission-line active galactic nucleus, all
        galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or
        absent H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and evolved stellar
        spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, elevated [N II]/H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical
        masses (M $_{dyn}$) by combining {\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$
        with structural parameters obtained from the Hubble Space
        Telescope COSMOS(-DASH) survey and compare them with stellar
        masses (M $_{*}$) derived using spectrophotometric modeling,
        considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass
        function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between M
        $_{dyn}$/M $_{*}$ and {\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$. This
        correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with
        high-{\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$ galaxies being more bottom
        heavy, was already in place at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2. When
        implementing the {\ensuremath{\sigma}} $_{ v }$-dependent IMF
        found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting
        for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a
        low scatter in M $_{dyn}$/M $_{*}$ of 0.14 dex. However, these
        assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed
        the dynamical masses by 34\%. This tension suggests that distant
        quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today's
        massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more
        complicated.}",

        COSMOS2020 catalog with complementary HST/F160W imaging from the
        3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z$\sim$2,
        roughly 50\% are recently quenched galaxies; these young
        quiescent galaxies become increasingly rare towards lower
        redshift, supporting the idea that the peak epoch of massive
        galaxy quenching occurred at z>2. Our data show that while the
        effective half-light radii of quiescent galaxies generally
        increases with time, young quiescent galaxies are significantly
        smaller than their older counterparts at the same redshift. In
        this work we investigate the connection between this size
        difference and other structural properties, including axis
        ratios, color gradients, stellar mass, and the intrinsic scatter
        in effective radii. We demonstrate that the size difference is
        driven by the most massive sub-population

        restricting the sample to intermediate mass galaxies

        scatter in physical size shows a strong co-evolution over the
        investigated time period and peaks around z$\sim$2 for both
        populations, only diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and
        assuming we are not missing a significant population of lower
        surface brightness galaxies, while the formation and quenching
        mechanisms that dominate at higher redshifts yield compact
        remnants, multiple evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse

        as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more
        massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first
        billion years of the Universe, suggested by recent observations,
        appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require
        highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even
        greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive
        galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust
        detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been
        challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric
        surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the
        James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-
        QG-1 at redshift $z=4.896$, 1.2 billion years after the Big
        Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal
        that the galaxy's stellar mass of $10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$,
        corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics, formed
        in a short $340\,$Myr burst of star formation, after which star
        formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According
        to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid
        stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to
        plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with
        JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that
        early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or
        exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than

        models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-

        Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar
        population properties from broadband photometry as part of the
        UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in
        spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample
        selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we
        quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model
        choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and
        age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in
        the star formation history (SFH), nonuniversal stellar initial
        mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular
        abundances, gas density, and ionizing photon budget. We find
        that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred
        properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1
        dex, 2{\textendash}5 times larger than the formal reported
        uncertainties in mass and SFR, and importantly, exceed the
        scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although
        the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy,
        our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of
        assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing
        multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true
        systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the
        inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and
        introduce {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged
        over a short timescale and {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.3 dex
        systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible
        nebular emission model causes {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 dex
        systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal
        uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a
        complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.}",

        and escape fractions (f$_{esc}$) from quasars support their role
        in driving cosmic reionization$^{5,6}$. Others propose that the
        high f$_{esc}$ values from bright galaxies generate sufficient

     abstract = "{Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking
        distances up to $z \sim 13$. The JWST UNCOVER (ultra-deep
        NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before the epoch of
        reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep multiwavelength
        NIRCam imaging of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 over
        $\sim 45$ arcmin$^{2}$ down to $\sim 29.5$ AB mag. Here, we
        present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived
        through lensing clusters at $9<z<12$. Using comprehensive end-
        to-end simulations, we account for all lensing effects and
        systematic uncertainties in deriving both the amplification
        factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confirm the
        intriguing excess of UV-bright galaxies ($M_{UV} < -20$ AB mag)
        previously reported at $z>9$ in recent JWST studies. In
        particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes better the
        bright-end of the luminosity function compared to the classical
        Schechter form. The number density of these bright galaxies is
        10-100 times larger than theoretical predictions and previous
        findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations.
        Additionally, we measure a star formation rate density of
        $\rho_{\rm SFR} = 10^{-2.64}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$
        at these redshifts, which is 4 to 10 times higher than galaxy
        formation models that assume a constant star formation
        efficiency. Future wide-area surveys and accurate modeling of
        lensing-assisted observations will reliably constrain both the
        bright and the dim end of the UV luminosity function at $z>9$,
        which will provide key benchmarks for galaxy formation models.}",

        the theories of early galaxy formation, yet to date, only three
        have been spectroscopically confirmed at z > 12. Due to strong
        gravitational lensing over a wide area, the galaxy cluster field
        A2744 is ideal for searching for the earliest galaxies. Here we
        present JWST/NIRSpec observations of two galaxies: a robust
        detection at ${z}_{\mathrm{spec}}={12.393}_{-0.001}^{+0.004}$ ,
        and a plausible candidate at
        ${z}_{\mathrm{spec}}={13.079}_{-0.001}^{+0.013}$ . The galaxies
        are discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging and their distances are
        inferred with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, all from the JWST Cycle
        1 UNCOVER Treasury survey. Detailed stellar population modeling
        using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data corroborates the primeval

        $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), young, rapidly assembling, metal-
        poor, and star-forming. Interestingly, both galaxies are
        spatially resolved, having lensing-corrected rest-UV effective
        radii on the order of 300-400 pc, which are notably larger than
        other spectroscopically confirmed systems at similar redshifts.
        The observed dynamic range of z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10 sizes
        spans over 1 order of magnitude, implying a significant scatter

        revealed an emerging population of red pointlike sources that
        could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black
        hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work, we present a
        JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury
        survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying
        a clear broad-line component as inferred from the
        H{\ensuremath{\beta}} line with FWHM = 3439 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        413 km s$^{-1}$, typical of the broad-line region of an active
        galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further
        supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines,
        and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of
        ${\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot })=8.17\pm
        0.42$ and a bolometric luminosity of L $_{bol}$

        Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the
        optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA,
        indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of
        ${\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }) 8.7$ , which would
        lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at
        least \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\%. This is orders of
        magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with
        recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding
        suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black
        holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a
        super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted
        number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec
        observations of larger samples will allow us to further
        investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.}",

        structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon
        (z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1-3). In this paper we
        leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744
        to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4um) structures of 11 sub-
        millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at

        bright ``classical'' sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). While these objects
        reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all exhibit
        decreasing sizes and increasing central concentration towards
        longer wavelengths. The smaller sizes of these objects at long
        wavelengths indicate that their stellar mass profiles are more
        compact than their optical light profiles, likely due to
        centrally-concentrated dust obscuration. Further, we find that
        galaxies with higher central concentration values tend to have
        more extreme size ratios (comparing the rest-frame NIR to rest-
        frame optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most
        compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust
        distributions. We also find the galaxies with the most extreme
        size ratios do not have elevated 1.2mm flux densities compared
        to the rest of our sample: we argue this means compact dust
        geometry, rather than e.g. high total dust quantity, drives the
        most extreme observed rest-frame NIR-to-optical size ratios.
        Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate
        joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the

        Bogdan et al. reported the detection of an X-ray luminous
        supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z > 10.
        Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new
        insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short
        time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the
        exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the

        with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We
        perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new
        NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The
        fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for the host galaxy that is

        resulting ratio of M $_{BH}$/M $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ remains
        2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus

        100\textbackslash\% for $z>9$ candidates reported in Atek et al.
        (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line
        detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates
        between the lines and the Ly$\alpha$ break alone with prism can
        be as large as $\pm0.2$, raising caution in designing future
        follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources. With spec-$z$
        confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower
        limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function

        consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at

        H$\beta$, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549)

        $z\simeq$ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray
        AGN LF estimated at $z\sim6$ and indicates a plausible cause of
        the high abundance of $z>9$ galaxies claimed in recent
        photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is
        confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at $z=8.50$
        with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These
        two sources show blueward Ly$\alpha$ line or continuum emission,
        suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a
        radius of $7.69\pm0.18$ pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a

        require rapid quenching, but it is unclear whether all quiescent
        galaxies have gone through this phase and what physical
        mechanisms are involved. To study rapid quenching, we use rest-
        frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.5. From spectral energy
        distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense
        starbursts prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with deep
        Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic observations for a subset of seven
        galaxies. Broad emission lines are detected for two galaxies,
        and are most likely caused by active galactic nucleus (AGN)
        activity. The other five galaxies do not show any emission
        features, suggesting that gas has already been removed or
        depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more compact
        than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a central
        starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average transition
        time of 300 Myr for the rapid quenching phase. Approximately 4\%
        of quiescent galaxies at z = 1.5 have gone through rapid
        quenching; this fraction increases to 23\% at z = 2.2. We
        identify analogs in the TNG100 simulation and find that rapid
        quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGNs, and for half of
        the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the starburst.
        We conclude that these young massive quiescent galaxies are not
        just rapidly quenched, but also rapidly formed through a major
        starburst. We speculate that mergers drive gas inflow toward the
        central regions and grow supermassive black holes, leading to
        rapid quenching by AGN feedback.}",

        The PROSPECTOR code is used to model spectral energy

        using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and
        ground-based photometry, with additional constraints on gas-

        highly dissipative gas compaction and accretion. The wide range
        of central densities and sizes observed in the sample suggests
        that, for the selected galaxies, such a process has started but
        is still far from being completed. The implication would be that
        selecting star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon frequently
        includes systems in an ``evolved'' evolutionary phase where the

        survey, the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date.
        Utilizing the ``Drift And SHift'' observing technique for HST-
        WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5
        deg$^{2}$ of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 deg$^{2}$, when
        combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are
        measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT
        (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-
        band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from
        the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in
        general, sizes and S{\'e}rsic indices of typical galaxies are
        accurate to limiting magnitudes of H $_{160}$ < 23 and H
        $_{160}$ < 22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space,
        galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological
        measurements out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2 and
        down to $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim 9$ . With
        the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a
        flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below
        $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim 10.5$ that persists
        out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2. We show that
        environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at
        least out to z = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may
        instead govern the structural evolution.}",

        largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing
        the ``Drift And SHift'' (DASH) observing technique for NIR
        imaging, in which guide star acquisition is only done once per
        orbit and instrument drift is corrected in post processing, the
        COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.7 square degrees of
        the UltraVISTA deep stripes. Global structural parameters are
        measured for about 50,000 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using
        GALFIT, with detection using a deep combined optical and near-
        infrared noise-equalized HST image. While the shallower depth of
        DASH observations and the non-standard data reduction techniques
        may not be ideal for low-mass or extended galaxies, we recover
        consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST
        morphological catalogs out to z=2 and
        log(M/Msun)\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10. As the DASH
        technique limits each pointing to an exposure time of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde300 seconds, the corresponding
        images are shallower than usual HST NIR imaging with 5-sigma
        depths of 25.1 ABmag. Here we test the parameter space where
        morphological fits of DASH galaxies are robustly recovered. In
        general, sizes and S{\'e}rsic indices of typical galaxies are
        accurately obtained for H(160)<23 and H(160)<22. In size-mass
        parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust
        morphologies in general below redshift 2 and log(M/Msun)>9. At
        log(M/Msun)<10.5, we find a flattening of the quiescent size-
        mass relation, implying the sizes of low mass quiescent galaxies
        are more similar to star-forming galaxies with a similar
        redshift and mass. Trends with axis-ratio and environment
        suggest that low mass galaxies that quench as satellites may
        retain morphologies comparable to similar mass star-forming
        galaxies.}",

        rotation curve for a distant gravitationally-lensed massive,

        redshift 1.77. Using VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopy, we perform a 2D

        curve, we fit a dark matter density profile and determine the
        functional form of the profile (cusp or core). Predictions from
        comparing the shape of the rotation curve of CL2244-1 to that of
        M33 and other galaxies in the local universe suggest that the
        dark matter profile of CL2244-1 is best represented by a cuspy
        profile. Though this cuspy profile supports the cold dark matter
        cosmological model, we cannot rule out self-interacting dark
