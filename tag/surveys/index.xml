In the next few months we will be creating a deep, multi-band HST-selected 3D-DASH photometric catalog utilizing all HST data in the entire COSMOS field, via the &lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> code (in progress). 3D-DASH imaging will also be utilized in a project to measure color gradients in z~2 quiescent galaxies, which then will help infer the overall shape of the star-formation histories of these quenched galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HLF GOODS-N Photometric Catalog</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/hlfgoodsn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/hlfgoodsn/</guid><description>&lt;p>Using the &lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> code (in development) we are building a robust photometric catalog from &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hlf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble Legacy Field&lt;/a> GOODS-N imaging. The catalog will contain psf-matched aperture photometry from 11 HST bands from the UV to near-IR.

Utilizing the &amp;ldquo;Drift And SHift&amp;rdquo; observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5 square degrees of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 sq. deg. when combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in general, sizes and Sérsic indices of typical galaxies are accurate to limiting magnitudes of H&amp;lt;23 and H&amp;lt;22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological measurements out to z~2 and down to logM~9. With the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below logM~10.5 that persists out to z~2. We show that environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to z=1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural evolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS-DASH</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hubble Space Telescope (HST) resolution is crucial in measuring the structural properties of high-redshift or blended galaxies. However, large area surveys are traditionally observationally expensive to obtain with HST, especially in the near-infrared. The COSMOS-DASH survey utilizes the novel &amp;ldquo;Drift And SHift&amp;rdquo; (DASH) technique to efficiently observe up to eight pointings in a single orbit using HST. This is done by guiding with gyros alone (i.e. diabling fine guidance sensors after the first pointing), which allows for wide-area surveys in the NIR with HST resolution, including the 0.49 square degree COSMOS-DASH survey. I lead the creation of the COSMOS-DASH morphological catalog, which provides structural parameters for over 50,000 galaxies with an increased number of massive galaxies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The COSMOS-DASH mosaics and morphological catalog, along with a more detailed description of the program are available on the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/cosmos-dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COSMOS-DASH MAST page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
