In the next few months we will be creating a deep, multi-band HST-selected 3D-DASH photometric catalog utilizing all HST data in the entire COSMOS field, via the &lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> code (in progress). 3D-DASH imaging will also be utilized in a project to measure color gradients in z~2 quiescent galaxies, which then will help infer the overall shape of the star-formation histories of these quenched galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HLF GOODS-N Photometric Catalog</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/hlfgoodsn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/hlfgoodsn/</guid><description>&lt;p>Using the &lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> code (in development) we are building a robust photometric catalog from &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hlf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble Legacy Field&lt;/a> GOODS-N imaging. The catalog will contain psf-matched aperture photometry from 11 HST bands from the UV to near-IR. Detailed information on the catalog creation process can be found for the &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab3853/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HLF GOODS-S Photometric Catalog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS-DASH</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hubble Space Telescope (HST) resolution is crucial in measuring the structural properties of high-redshift or blended galaxies. However, large area surveys are traditionally observationally expensive to obtain with HST, especially in the near-infrared. The COSMOS-DASH survey utilizes the novel &amp;ldquo;Drift And SHift&amp;rdquo; (DASH) technique to efficiently observe up to eight pointings in a single orbit using HST. This is done by guiding with gyros alone (i.e. diabling fine guidance sensors after the first pointing), which allows for wide-area surveys in the NIR with HST resolution, including the 0.49 square degree COSMOS-DASH survey. I lead the creation of the COSMOS-DASH morphological catalog, which provides structural parameters for over 50,000 galaxies with an increased number of massive galaxies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The COSMOS-DASH mosaics and morphological catalog, along with a more detailed description of the program are available on the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/cosmos-dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COSMOS-DASH MAST page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resolved SED fitting with Prospector</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/resolved-prospector/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/resolved-prospector/</guid><description>&lt;p>The formation of the central parts of &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; star-forming galaxies is an open question in astronomy. To investigate this, we present a sample of 60 z~2.3 main-sequence galaxies from the &lt;a href="http://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)&lt;/a> spectroscopic survey. Using the &lt;a href="https://prospect.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospector code&lt;/a> with strong metallicity priors from MOSDEF spectra, we fit SEDs to resolved central and outer components, using a novel iterative method to robustly incorporate unresolved &lt;em>Spitzer&lt;/em>/IRAC and &lt;em>K&lt;/em>-band data. This technique allows us to get well-constrained, non-parametric star formation histories for the central and outer regions of these typical main-sequence galaxies (see the figure above), which provides insight into the overall assembly of star-forming galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
