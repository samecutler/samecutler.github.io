In the next few months we will be creating a deep, multi-band HST-selected 3D-DASH photometric catalog utilizing all HST data in the entire COSMOS field, via the &lt;a href="https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> code&lt;/a>. 3D-DASH imaging will also be utilized in a project to measure color gradients in z~2 quiescent galaxies, which then will help infer the overall shape of the star-formation histories of these quenched galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HLF GOODS-N Photometric Catalog</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/hlfgoodsn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/hlfgoodsn/</guid><description>&lt;p>Using the &lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> code (in development) we are building a robust photometric catalog from &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hlf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble Legacy Field&lt;/a> GOODS-N imaging. The catalog will contain psf-matched aperture photometry from 11 HST bands from the UV to near-IR. Detailed information on the catalog creation process can be found for the &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab3853/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HLF GOODS-S Photometric Catalog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS-DASH</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hubble Space Telescope (HST) resolution is crucial in measuring the structural properties of high-redshift or blended galaxies. However, large area surveys are traditionally observationally expensive to obtain with HST, especially in the near-infrared. The COSMOS-DASH survey utilizes the novel &amp;ldquo;Drift And SHift&amp;rdquo; (DASH) technique to efficiently observe up to eight pointings in a single orbit using HST. This is done by guiding with gyros alone (i.e. diabling fine guidance sensors after the first pointing), which allows for wide-area surveys in the NIR with HST resolution, including the 0.49 square degree COSMOS-DASH survey. I lead the creation of the COSMOS-DASH morphological catalog, which provides structural parameters for over 50,000 galaxies with an increased number of massive galaxies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The COSMOS-DASH mosaics and morphological catalog, along with a more detailed description of the program are available on the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/cosmos-dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COSMOS-DASH MAST page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resolved SED fitting with Prospector</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/resolved-prospector/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/resolved-prospector/</guid><description>&lt;p>The formation of the central parts of &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; star-forming galaxies is an open question in astronomy. To investigate this, we present a sample of 60 z~2.3 main-sequence galaxies from the &lt;a href="http://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)&lt;/a> spectroscopic survey. Using the &lt;a href="https://prospect.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospector code&lt;/a> with strong metallicity priors from MOSDEF spectra, we fit SEDs to resolved central and outer components, using a novel iterative method to robustly incorporate unresolved &lt;em>Spitzer&lt;/em>/IRAC and &lt;em>K&lt;/em>-band data. This technique allows us to get well-constrained, non-parametric star formation histories for the central and outer regions of these typical main-sequence galaxies (see the figure above), which provides insight into the overall assembly of star-forming galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PRIMER</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/primer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/primer/</guid><description>&lt;p>The JWST &lt;a href="https://primer-jwst.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRIMER&lt;/a> Treasury survey is a
378 sq. arcmin. survey covering the COSMOS and UDS legacy fields down to 28 ABmag in F200W. PRIMER provides NIRCam observations in F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W, supplemented by archival HST WFC3 and ACS data. As a member of the PRIMER team, I have been utilizing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> aperture photometry pipeline&lt;/a> to build high-quality, PSF-homogenized photometric catalogs. Currently, catalogs for the v7 (July 2023) mosaics from &lt;a href="https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DJA&lt;/a> are prepared. These are available by request and subsequent approval from the PRIMER team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quiescent Galaxy Sizes with JWST</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/jwst-sizes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/jwst-sizes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Several previous HST-based studies (including &lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...34C/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cutler et al. 2022&lt;/a>) have found a flattening of sizes at the low-mass end of the quiescent size-mass relation. Using the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution, and redder wavelength coverage of JWST/NIRCam, we investigate the sizes of low-mass quiescent galaxies in the &lt;a href="https://primer-jwst.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRIMER&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://jwst-uncover.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNCOVER&lt;/a> Treasury surveys at cosmic noon (1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3). A sample of 332 7&amp;lt;logM&amp;lt;11 galaxies are selected using &lt;em>UVJ&lt;/em> and sSFR criteria and modeled in both F150W and F444W using (&lt;em>GALFIT&lt;/em>)[https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html]. With these measurements, we find the properties of low-mass quiescent galaxies differ dramatically from their massive counterparts and are better classified as an entirely separate population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UNCOVER</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/uncover/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/uncover/</guid><description>&lt;p>The JWST &lt;a href="https://jwst-uncover.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNCOVER&lt;/a> Treasury survey is a 45 sq. arcmin. survey covering the Abell 2744 lensing cluster (in combination with GLASS and DDT data). UNCOVER is the deepest-to-date publicly available survey, reaching fainter than 29 ABmag without corrections for lensing. Between UNCOVER and other public NIRCam data, Abell 2744 is covered by observations in F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W, supplemented by archival HST WFC3 and ACS data. As a survey builder in the UNCOVER team, I have been involved in the development of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;em>aperpy&lt;/em> aperture photometry pipeline&lt;/a>, which we use to produce a high-quality, PSF-homogenized photometric catalog for all space-based data covering Abell 2744 (&lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJS..270....7W%2F/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weaver et al. 2024&lt;/a>). Specifically, I am primarily involved in empirical PSF generation via stacked, unsaturated stars and homogenization to a common PSF utilizing regularization.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
