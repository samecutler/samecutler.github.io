     abstract = "{We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size{\textendash}mass
        relation at cosmic noon (1 < z < 3) from the JWST PRIMER and
        UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlights two distinct classes
        of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well
        studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously
        underexplored due to a lack of observing facilities with
        sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution. We select a
        conservative sample of low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates
        using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate
        criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame
        UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared
        (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous flattening of the low-mass
        quiescent size{\textendash}mass relation, which results from the
        separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct
        populations at $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim
        10.3$ : low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and
        have disky structures, and massive galaxies consistent with
        spheroidal morphologies and older median stellar ages. These
        separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the
        massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or
        feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar
        mass-dependent slope of the quiescent size{\textendash}mass
        relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to
        star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive
        galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations
        also corresponds with other dramatic changes and characteristic
        masses in several galaxy evolution scaling relations (e.g., star
        formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-to-halo mass
        ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-
        mass and massive galaxy formation.}",

        Photometry is decomposed into a central and an outer spatial
        component using observed z $_{F850LP}$ - H $_{F160W}$ colors.
        The PROSPECTOR code is used to model spectral energy
        distributions for the center, outskirt, and integrated galaxy
        using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and
        ground-based photometry, with additional constraints on gas-
        phase metallicity and spectroscopic redshift from MOSDEF
        spectroscopy. For the low-resolution bands, spatially resolved
        photometry is determined with an iterative approach. The
        reconstructed SFHs indicate that the majority of galaxies with
        $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot }) 10.5$ are observed
        while their central regions undergo relatively recent (<100 Myr)
        bursts of star formation, whereas the outskirts have a smooth,
        quasi-steady SFH that gently increases toward the redshift of
        observation. The enhanced star formation activity of the central
        parts is broadly consistent with the idea that it is produced by
        highly dissipative gas compaction and accretion. The wide range
        of central densities and sizes observed in the sample suggests
        that, for the selected galaxies, such a process has started but
        is still far from being completed. The implication would be that
        selecting star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon frequently
        includes systems in an ``evolved'' evolutionary phase where the
        centers have recently started a burst of star formation activity
        that will likely initiate inside-out quenching in the next
        several hundred million years.}",

     abstract = "{We present the H $_{160}$ morphological catalogs for the COSMOS-DASH
        survey, the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date.
        Utilizing the ``Drift And SHift'' observing technique for HST-
        WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5
        deg$^{2}$ of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 deg$^{2}$, when
        combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are
        measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT
        (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-
        band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from
        the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in
        general, sizes and S{\'e}rsic indices of typical galaxies are
        accurate to limiting magnitudes of H $_{160}$ < 23 and H
        $_{160}$ < 22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space,
        galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological
        measurements out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2 and
        down to $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim 9$ . With
        the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a
        flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below
        $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot })\sim 10.5$ that persists
        out to z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2. We show that
        environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at
        least out to z = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may
        instead govern the structural evolution.}",
