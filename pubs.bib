     abstract = "{The existence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift seems to
        require rapid quenching, but it is unclear whether all quiescent
        galaxies have gone through this phase and what physical
        mechanisms are involved. To study rapid quenching, we use rest-
        frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z~1.5.
        From spectral energy distribution fitting, we find that
        they all experienced intense starbursts prior to rapid
        quenching. We confirm this with deep Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic
        observations for a subset of seven galaxies. Broad emission
        lines are detected for two galaxies and are most likely caused
        by AGN activity. The other five galaxies do not show any
        emission features, suggesting that gas has already been removed
        or depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more
        compact than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a
        central starburst in the recent past. We estimate an average
        transition time of 300 Myr for the rapid quenching phase.
        Approximately 4% of quiescent galaxies at z=1.5 have gone
        through rapid quenching; this fraction increases to 23% at
        z=2.2. We identify analogs in the TNG100 simulation and find
        that rapid quenching for these galaxies is driven by AGN, and
        for half of the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger
        the starburst. We conclude that these massive quiescent galaxies
        are not just rapidly quenched but also rapidly formed through a
        major starburst. We speculate that mergers drive gas inflow
        towards the central regions and grow supermassive black holes,
        leading to rapid quenching by AGN feedback.}",

        for 60 z~2.3 main-sequence, star-forming galaxies selected

        Photometry is decomposed into a central and outer spatial
        component using observed z_F850LP-H_F160W
        colors. The Prospector code is used to model spectral energy
        distributions for the centers, outskirts, and integrated galaxy
        using HST/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based
        photometry, with additional constraints on metallicity and
        spectroscopic redshift from MOSDEF spectroscopy. For the low-
        resolution bands, spatially-resolved photometry is determined
        with an iterative approach. The reconstructed SFHs indicate that
        the majority of galaxies with logM<10.5 are
        observed while their central regions undergo relatively recent
        (<100 Myr) bursts of star formation, while the outskirts have
        a smooth, quasi-steady SFH. The enhanced star formation activity
        of the central parts is broadly consistent with the idea that it
        is produced by highly dissipative gas compaction and accretion.
        The broad dispersion of central density and size observed in the
        sample suggests that for the selected galaxies this process has
        started but is still far from being completed. The implication
        would be that selecting star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon
        frequently includes systems in an "evolved" evolutionary phase
        where the centers have recently started a burst of star
        formation activity that will likely initiate inside-out
        quenching in the next several hundred million years.}",
