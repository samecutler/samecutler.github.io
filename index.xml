Photometry is decomposed into a central and outer spatial component using observed z_F850LP-H_F160W colors. The Prospector code is used to model spectral energy distributions for the centers, outskirts, and integrated galaxy using HST/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based photometry, with additional constraints on gas-phase metallicity and spectroscopic redshift from MOSDEF spectroscopy. For the low-resolution bands, spatially-resolved photometry is determined with an iterative approach. The reconstructed SFHs indicate that the majority of galaxies with logM&amp;lt;10.5 are observed while their central regions undergo relatively recent (&amp;lt;100 Myr) bursts of star formation, while the outskirts have a smooth, quasi-steady SFH. The enhanced star formation activity of the central parts is broadly consistent with the idea that it is produced by highly dissipative gas compaction and accretion. The wide range of central densities and sizes observed in the sample suggests that for the selected galaxies this process has started but is still far from being completed. The implication would be that selecting star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon frequently includes systems in an &amp;ldquo;evolved&amp;rdquo; evolutionary phase where the centers have recently started a burst of star formation activity that will likely initiate inside-out quenching in the next several hundred million years.&lt;/p>

Utilizing the &amp;ldquo;Drift And SHift&amp;rdquo; observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5 square degrees of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 sq. deg. when combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in general, sizes and Sérsic indices of typical galaxies are accurate to limiting magnitudes of H&amp;lt;23 and H&amp;lt;22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological measurements out to z~2 and down to logM~9. With the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below logM~10.5 that persists out to z~2. We show that environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to z=1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural evolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS-DASH</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:51:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/project/cosmos-dash/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hubble Space Telescope (HST) resolution is crucial in measuring the structural properties of high-redshift or blended galaxies. However, large area surveys are traditionally observationally expensive to obtain with HST, especially in the near-infrared. The COSMOS-DASH survey utilizes the novel &amp;ldquo;Drift And SHift&amp;rdquo; (DASH) technique to efficiently observe up to eight pointings in a single orbit using HST. This is done by guiding with gyros alone (i.e. diabling fine guidance sensors after the first pointing), which allows for wide-area surveys in the NIR with HST resolution, including the 0.49 square degree COSMOS-DASH survey. I lead the creation of the COSMOS-DASH morphological catalog, which provides structural parameters for over 50,000 galaxies with an increased number of massive galaxies.&lt;/p>

To investigate this, we present a sample of 60 z~2.3 main-sequence galaxies from the &lt;a href="http://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)&lt;/a> spectroscopic survey. Using the &lt;a href="https://prospect.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospector code&lt;/a> with strong metallicity priors from MOSDEF spectra, we fit SEDs to resolved central and outer components, using a novel iterative method to robustly incorporate unresolved &lt;em>Spitzer&lt;/em>/IRAC and &lt;em>K&lt;/em>-band data. This technique allows us to get well-constrained, non-parametric star formation histories for the central and outer regions of these typical main-sequence galaxies (see the figure above), which provides insight into the overall assembly of star-forming galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Differential Assembly of the Centers and Outskirts of Main Sequence Galaxies at z~2.3</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/talk/the-differential-assembly-of-the-centers-and-outskirts-of-main-sequence-galaxies-at-z~2.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/talk/the-differential-assembly-of-the-centers-and-outskirts-of-main-sequence-galaxies-at-z~2.3/</guid><description>&lt;p>We present a sample of 60 z~2.3 main sequence, star-forming galaxies from the MOSDEF survey in GOODS-N with SED fits to decomposed central and outer components. These galaxies are decomposed into two components using apertures selected from observed z-H colors. SED fitting is done with Prospector on HST ACS and WFC3, &lt;em>Spitzer&lt;/em>/IRAC, and ground-based photometry, with additional constraints from MOSDEF metallicities and spectroscopic redshifts. Because we decompose the galaxies into only two components, we are able to iteratively determine the IRAC and ground-based photometry of each component while conserving total flux. Our final sample contains stellar population parameters and SFHs for the center, outskirts, and integrated light of each galaxy. SFHs indicate that the majority of galaxies with logM&amp;lt;10.5 form their central region in bursts of star formation. Moreover, the galaxies with the sharpest peaks in SFR span a wide range in size and central density. This implies that the formation of these central parts likely occurred via an increase in the accretion rate of star forming clumps, rather than the collapse of a gaseous disk. Further analysis of the uncertainties from the decomposition and choice of priors is necessary to determine if these results are robust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diagnosing DASH: A Morphological Catalog for the COSMOS-DASH Survey</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/talk/diagnosing-dash-a-morphological-catalog-for-the-cosmos-dash-survey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/talk/diagnosing-dash-a-morphological-catalog-for-the-cosmos-dash-survey/</guid><description>&lt;p>COSMOS-DASH is a 0.5 square degree survey of the COSMOS field, obtained utilizing the novel “Drift And SHift” (DASH) observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging. While DASH observations are significantly more efficient than standard HST imaging, they also are shallower and have an unusual data reduction, both of which may impact morphology measurements for fainter galaxies. In this talk I will present the F160W morphological catalog for for 51,534 galaxies in the COSMOS-DASH survey. Using morphological measurements from GALFIT, we recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs out to z=2 and logM~10. I will also discuss the parameter space where morphological fits of DASH galaxies are robustly recovered. At logM&amp;lt;10.5, we find a flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation, implying the sizes of low mass quiescent galaxies are more similar to star-forming galaxies with a similar redshift and mass. Trends with axis-ratio and environment also suggest that low mass galaxies that quench in low density environments may retain morphologies comparable to similar mass star-forming galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diagnosing DASH: A Morphological Catalog for the COSMOS-DASH Survey</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/publication/2021-aas-23734211-c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/publication/2021-aas-23734211-c/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Examining High Redshift Rotation Curves and Dark Matter Profiles Outside the Local Universe</title><link>https://samecutler.github.io/publication/2018-aas-23135603-c/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/publication/2018-aas-23135603-c/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://samecutler.github.io/admin/config.yml</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samecutler.github.io/admin/config.yml</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
