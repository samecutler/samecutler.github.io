abstract: "Wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys are key to probing the evolution of massive galaxies at high redshift. The 3D-DASH survey offers the largest NIR image with the Hubble Space Telescope to date, covering over 1.43 sq. deg. of the COSMOS field in WFC3/F160W imaging. Combining this NIR data with existing optical imaging from ACS/F814W, multi-wavelength studies of galaxy colors and  stellar populations can be conducted across almost the entirety of the COSMOS field. In this talk, I will present the 3D-DASH F160W mosaic and related tools, now available to the community. We demonstrate that morphological parameters describing galaxy shapes in DASH imaging are robust out to z~2 and down to log(M)~9.  In addition to measuring the size-mass relation of massive galaxies, I will also share preliminary results studying the resolved star-formation histories of massive quenched galaxies."
