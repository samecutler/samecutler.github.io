The formation of the central parts of "typical" star-forming galaxies is an open question in astronomy. To investigate this, we present a sample of 60 z~2.3 main-sequence galaxies from the [MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)](http://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu) spectroscopic survey. Using the [Prospector code](https://prospect.readthedocs.io/) with strong metallicity priors from MOSDEF spectra, we fit SEDs to resolved inner (bulge) and outer (disk) components, using a novel iterative method to robustly incorporate unresolved *Spitzer*/IRAC and *K*-band data. This technique allows us to get well-constrained, non-parametric star formation histories for the central and outer regions of these typical main-sequence galaxies (see the figure above), which provides insight into the overall assembly of Milky-Way-like galaxies.
