The JWST [UNCOVER](https://jwst-uncover.github.io) Treasury survey is a 45 sq. arcmin. survey covering the Abell 2744 lensing cluster (in combination with GLASS and DDT data). UNCOVER is the deepest-to-date publicly available survey, reaching fainter than 29 ABmag without corrections for lensing. Between UNCOVER and other public NIRCam data, Abell 2744 is covered by observations in F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W, supplemented by archival HST WFC3 and ACS data. As a survey builder in the UNCOVER team, I have been involved in the development of the [*aperpy* aperture photometry pipeline](https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy), which we use to produce a high-quality, PSF-homogenized photometric catalog for all space-based data covering Abell 2744 ([Weaver et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJS..270....7W%2F/abstract)). Specifically, I am primarily involved in empirical PSF generation via stacked, unsaturated stars and homogenization to a common PSF utilizing regularization.
