The JWST [PRIMER](https://primer-jwst.github.io) Treasury survey is a
378 sq. arcmin. survey covering the COSMOS and UDS legacy fields down to 28 ABmag in F200W. PRIMER provides NIRCam observations in F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W, supplemented by archival HST WFC3 and ACS data. As a member of the PRIMER team, I have been utilizing the [*aperpy* aperture photometry pipeline](https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy) to build high-quality, PSF-homogenized photometric catalogs. Currently, catalogs for the v7 (July 2023) mosaics from [DJA](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/) are prepared. These are available by request and subsequent approval from the PRIMER team.
