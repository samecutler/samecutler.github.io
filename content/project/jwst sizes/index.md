Several previous HST-based studies (including [Cutler et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...34C/abstract)) have found a flattening of sizes at the low-mass end of the quiescent size-mass relation. Using the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution, and redder wavelength coverage of JWST/NIRCam, we investigate the sizes of low-mass quiescent galaxies in the [PRIMER](https://primer-jwst.github.io) and [UNCOVER](https://jwst-uncover.github.io) Treasury surveys at cosmic noon (1<z<3). A sample of 332 7<logM<11 galaxies are selected using *UVJ* and sSFR criteria and modeled in both F150W and F444W using (*GALFIT*)[https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html]. With these measurements, we find the properties of low-mass quiescent galaxies differ dramatically from their massive counterparts and are better classified as an entirely separate population.
