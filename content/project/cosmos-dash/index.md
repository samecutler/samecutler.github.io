COSMOS-Drift And SHift (COSMOS-DASH) is a 0.49 square degree near-IR survey of the COSMOS field using HST/WFC3 in the F160W filter. Using the DASH technique, up to eight pointings can be observed per orbit using HST. This is done by guiding with gyros alone (i.e. diabling fine guidance sensors after the first pointing), which allows for wide-area surveys in the NIR with HST resolution. I lead the creation of the COSMOS-DASH morphological catalog, which provides structural parameters for over 50,000 galaxies with an increased number of massive galaxies.
