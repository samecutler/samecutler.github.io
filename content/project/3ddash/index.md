3D-DASH is the follow-up program to COSMOS-DASH, extending the total area to 1.43 sq. deg. in HST WFC3/F160W, making it the largest survey done by HST in the near-IR. 3D-DASH imaging and related tools are available on the [3D-DASH MAST page](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/3d-dash). In the next few months we will be creating a deep, multi-band HST-selected 3D-DASH photometric catalog utilizing all HST data in the entire COSMOS field, via the [*aperpy* code](https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy). 3D-DASH imaging will also be utilized in a project to measure color gradients in z~2 quiescent galaxies, which then will help infer the overall shape of the star-formation histories of these quenched galaxies.
