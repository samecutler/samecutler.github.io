abstract: Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking distances
  up to $z ∼ 13$. The JWST UNCOVER (ultra-deep NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before
  the epoch of reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep multiwavelength NIRCam
  imaging of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 over $∼ 45$ arcmin$^2$ down to
  $∼ 29.5$ AB mag. Here, we present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function
  derived through lensing clusters at $9<z<12$. Using comprehensive end- to-end simulations,
  we account for all lensing effects and systematic uncertainties in deriving both
  the amplification factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confirm the
  intriguing excess of UV-bright galaxies ($M_UV < -20$ AB mag) previously reported
  at $z>9$ in recent JWST studies. In particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes
  better the bright-end of the luminosity function compared to the classical Schechter
  form. The number density of these bright galaxies is 10-100 times larger than theoretical
  predictions and previous findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations.
  Additionally, we measure a star formation rate density of $h̊o_ ̊SFR = 10^-2.64$
  M$_ødot$ yr$^-1$ Mpc$^-3$ at these redshifts, which is 4 to 10 times higher than
  galaxy formation models that assume a constant star formation efficiency. Future
  wide-area surveys and accurate modeling of lensing-assisted observations will reliably
  constrain both the bright and the dim end of the UV luminosity function at $z>9$,
  which will provide key benchmarks for galaxy formation models.
