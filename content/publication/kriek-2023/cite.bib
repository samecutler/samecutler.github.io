 abstract = {In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultra-
deep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies
at $1.4łesssim złesssim 2.2$ with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With
integration times of up to 16 hrs per band per galaxy, we
observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in
atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic
redshifts for all 21 galaxies and for 19 we also measure stellar
velocity dispersions ($σ_v$), ages, and elemental
abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one
emission-line AGN, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent
through their faint or absent H$α$ emission and evolved
stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint H$α$,
elevated [NII]/H$α$ suggests a non-star-forming origin. We
calculate dynamical masses ($M_m̊ dyn$) by combining
$σ_v$ with structural parameters obtained from
HST/COSMOS(-DASH), and compare them with stellar masses ($M_*$)
derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various
assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe
a strong correlation between $M_\ ̊dyn/M_*$ and $σ_v$.
This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with
high-$σ_v$ galaxies being more bottom-heavy, was already in
place at $z∼2$. When implementing the $σ_v$-dependent
IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and
correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements,
we find a low scatter in $M_\rd̊yn/M_*$ of 0.14 dex. However,
these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which
exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that
distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into
today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more
complicated.},
