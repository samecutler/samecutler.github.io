abstract: In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultra-deep
  medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at 1.4≲ z≲ 2.2 with Keck/LRIS
  and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16 hrs per band per galaxy, we observe
  numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully
  derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies and for 19 we also measure stellar
  velocity dispersions (σ_v), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying
  paper. Except for one emission-line AGN, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent
  through their faint or absent Hα emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most
  galaxies exhibiting faint Hα, elevated [NII]/Hα suggests a non-star-forming origin.
  We calculate dynamical masses (M_ dyn) by combining σ_v with structural parameters
  obtained from HST/COSMOS(-DASH), and compare them with stellar masses (M_*) derived
  using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed
  initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between M_ dyn/M_*
  and σ_v. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-σ_v galaxies
  being more bottom-heavy, was already in place at z∼2. When implementing the σ_v-dependent
  IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in
  our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in M_ dyn/M_* of 0.14
  dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed
  the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies
  do not simply grow inside-out into today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution
  is more complicated.
