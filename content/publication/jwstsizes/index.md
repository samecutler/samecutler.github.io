title: "Two Distinct Classes of Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER"
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Using the JWST UNCOVER and PRIMER Treasury surveys, we measure the sizes of 332 7<logM<11 quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon (1<z<3). We find that there exist two distinct populations of quiescent galaxies at this epoch: a young, low-mass, disky population and an older, massive, spheroidal population, further highlighting the different mechanisms involved in galaxy evolution at low masses.'

abstract: 'We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation at Cosmic Noon (1<z<3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlight two distinct classes of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously under-explored due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution (in the rest-frame near-IR). We select a conservative sample of robust low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near- infrared (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous "flattening" of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation, which results from the separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct populations at logMâˆ¼10.3: low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and have disky structures, and massive galaxies with prolate morphologies and older median stellar ages. These separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar mass dependent slope of the quiescent size-mass relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations also corresponds with other dramatic changes in galaxy evolutions (e.g. star-formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-halo mass ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy formation.'
