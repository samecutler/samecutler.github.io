abstract: Understanding the history of star formation in galaxies is key to gaining
  a more comprehensive picture of galaxy formation, evolution, and quenching. However,
  a significant amount of photometric and/or spectroscopic data is necessary to robustly
  model the non-parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies. Semi-resolved
  SFHs also require the photometry and spectroscopy to be spatially resolved, which
  limits the use of longer-wavelength data. We present a study of the semi-resolved,
  2-component SFHs of 60 z~2 main-sequence, star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-N field,
  modeled using the Prospector code with a novel iterative method to incorporate unresolved
  K-band/IRAC data. Our results suggest that selecting star-forming galaxies at cosmic
  noon may frequently include systems in an ``evolved'' evolutionary phase where the
  centers have recently started a burst of star-formation activity that will likely
  initiate inside-out quenching in the next several hundred million years. Due to
  the extensive data sets required to model resolved SFHs, we also develop a model
  to match observed F814W-F160W color gradients from 3D-DASH and COSMOS/ACS imaging
  to quenching and formation timescales of quenched galaxies at z~2. These timescales
  provide an overview of the galaxies' formation time (early or late) and quenching
  speed (fast or slow), suggesting that the overall evolutionary history of these
  quenched galaxies at this epoch can be inferred using semi-revolved color gradients.
