abstract: Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking distances
  up to z ~ 13. The JWST UNCOVER (ultra-deep NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before
  the epoch of reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep multiwavelength NIRCam
  imaging of the massive galaxy cluster A2744 over ~45 arcmin^2 down to rs̊ebox-0.5ex~29.5
  AB mag. Here, we present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived through
  lensing clusters at 9 < z < 12. Using comprehensive end-to-end simulations, we account
  for all lensing effects and systematic uncertainties in deriving both the amplification
  factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confithe intriguing excess
  of UV-bright galaxies (M_UV <-20 AB mag) previously reported at z > 9 in recent
  JWST studies. In particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes better the bright
  end of the luminosity function compared to the classical Schechter form. The number
  density of these bright galaxies is 10-100 times larger than theoretical predictions
  and previous findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally,
  we measure a star formation rate density of rh̊_SFR = 10^-2.64 M_⊙ yr^-1 Mpc^-3
  at these redshifts, which is 4-10 times higher than galaxy formation models that
  assume a constant star formation efficiency. Future wide-area surveys and accurate
  modelling of lensing-assisted observations will reliably constrain both the bright
  and the dim end of the UV luminosity function at z > 9, which will provide key benchmarks
  for galaxy formation models.
