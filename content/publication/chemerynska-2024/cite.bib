 abstract = {Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking
distances up to z åisebox-0.5ex~ 13. The JWST
UNCOVER (ultra-deep NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before the
epoch of reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep
multiwavelength NIRCam imaging of the massive galaxy cluster
A2744 over \i̊sebox-0.5ex~45 arcmin$^2$ down
to \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~29.5 AB mag. Here, we present
a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived through
lensing clusters at 9 < z < 12. Using comprehensive end-to-end
simulations, we account for all lensing effects and systematic
uncertainties in deriving both the amplification factors and the
effective survey volume. Our results confirm the intriguing
excess of UV-bright galaxies (M$_UV$ <-20 AB mag) previously
reported at z > 9 in recent JWST studies. In particular, a
double power-law (DPL) describes better the bright end of the
luminosity function compared to the classical Schechter form.
The number density of these bright galaxies is 10-100 times
larger than theoretical predictions and previous findings based
on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we
measure a star formation rate density of
\ensuremath\rh̊$_SFR$ = 10$^-2.64$
M$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$ Mpc$^-3$ at these
redshifts, which is 4-10 times higher than galaxy formation
models that assume a constant star formation efficiency. Future
wide-area surveys and accurate modelling of lensing-assisted
observations will reliably constrain both the bright and the dim
end of the UV luminosity function at z > 9, which will provide
key benchmarks for galaxy formation models.},
