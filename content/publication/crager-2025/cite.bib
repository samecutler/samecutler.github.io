 abstract = {While massive galaxies are known to host a supermassive black hole at
their centers, the interplay between active black hole growth
and star formation in the host galaxy is not well understood.
With the advent of JWST, we can view unprecedented detail in the
morphology of galaxies that were previously unresolvable,
especially in dust-obscured galaxies. These advancements are
crucial in understanding the co-evolution of active black hole
growth and star formation in a galaxy. In this work, we
investigate how galaxy morphology changes as a function of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) strength. We present a sample of
dusty galaxies with zåisebox-0.5ex~2 in the
GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields with measured mid-infrared AGN
fractions from previous Spitzer data. We identify counterparts
in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) NIRCam
data based on photometric redshifts and coordinates to generate
a sample of 44 galaxies. We conduct both a visual morphology
survey and a quantitative analysis with Statmorph to calculate
nonparametric measurements of galaxy structure; Concentration,
Asymmetry, Gini, and M20. We find that galaxies with a higher
AGN fraction tend to be spheroidal in shape, more symmetric, and
don't tend to look like major mergers. Additionally, we find
that AGN-dominated galaxies tend to have more focused light
(high Gini) but not necessarily a higher central concentration
of light. Our study shows that NIRCam imaging can provide a
clear picture of galaxy structure even in heavily dust-obscured
galaxies.},
