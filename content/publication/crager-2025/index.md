abstract: While massive galaxies are known to host a supermassive black hole at their
  centers, the interplay between active black hole growth and star formation in the
  host galaxy is not well understood. With the advent of JWST, we can view unprecedented
  detail in the morphology of galaxies that were previously unresolvable, especially
  in dust-obscured galaxies. These advancements are crucial in understanding the co-evolution
  of active black hole growth and star formation in a galaxy. In this work, we investigate
  how galaxy morphology changes as a function of active galactic nuclei (AGN) strength.
  We present a sample of dusty galaxies with z~2 in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields
  with measured mid-infrared AGN fractions from previous Spitzer data. We identify
  counterparts in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) NIRCam data
  based on photometric redshifts and coordinates to generate a sample of 44 galaxies.
  We conduct both a visual morphology survey and a quantitative analysis with Statmorph
  to calculate nonparametric measurements of galaxy structure; Concentration, Asymmetry,
  Gini, and M20. We find that galaxies with a higher AGN fraction tend to be spheroidal
  in shape, more symmetric, and don't tend to look like major mergers. Additionally,
  we find that AGN-dominated galaxies tend to have more focused light (high Gini)
  but not necessarily a higher central concentration of light. Our study shows that
  NIRCam imaging can provide a clear picture of galaxy structure even in heavily dust-obscured
  galaxies.
