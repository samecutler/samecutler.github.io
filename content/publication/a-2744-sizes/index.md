abstract: Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense
  regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of
  star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions
  with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster
  galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of
  quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at
  z<0.5. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs,
  we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between 7<log(M_⋆/M_⊙)<10
  using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1531 galaxies in the z=0.308 Abell 2744
  galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation has a significantly higher scatter
  than similar-redshift field samples, despite comparable best-fit relations in both
  the dwarf and intermediate-mass regimes. Both ``progenitor bias'', where larger,
  diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion
  of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary
  framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent
  galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived
  for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late,
  at z<1.5. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio
  distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this
  leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the
  observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an
  onset of quenching due to the environment.
