abstract: "We present the F160W morphological catalogs for the COSMOS-DASH survey, the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing the "Drift And SHift" observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5 square degrees of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 sq. deg. when combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in general, sizes and SÃ©rsic indices of typical galaxies are accurate to limiting magnitudes of H<23 and H<22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological measurements out to z~2 and down to logM~9. With the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below logM~10.5 that persists out to z~2.  We show that environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to z=1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural evolution."

summary: We present an HST-resolution morphological catalog of over 50,000 galaxies in the COSMOS field utilizing the "Drift And SHift" (DASH) observing mode. We test the limits of DASH observations for determining morphologies of galaxies across a wide range of masses and redshifts.
