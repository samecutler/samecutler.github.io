abstract: We present the H_160 morphological catalogs for the COSMOS-DASH survey,
  the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing the “Drift And
  SHift” observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately
  0.5 deg^2 of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 deg^2, when combined with archival
  data). Global structural parameters are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH
  using GALFIT (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-band
  HST image. We recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological
  catalogs, finding that, in general, sizes and Sérsic indices of typical galaxies
  are accurate to limiting magnitudes of H_160 < 23 and H_160 < 22 ABmag, respectively.
  In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological
  measurements out to z åisebox-0.5ex  2 and down to (M_⋆/M_ødot )∼ 9 . With the advantage
  of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent size-mass
  relation below (M_⋆/M_ødot )∼ 10.5 that persists out to z ı̊sebox-0.5ex  2. We show
  that environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to z
  = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural evolution.
