abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is now detecting early black holes (BHs)
  as they transition from “seeds” to supermassive BHs. Recently, Bogdan et al. reported
  the detection of an X-ray luminous supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift
  at z > 10. Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights
  on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation
  and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report
  the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 ± 0.002. We find that the
  NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z ≈ 10 galaxies, characterized
  primarily by star formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray
  source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration
  of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the
  X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy
  and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar-mass estimate for
  the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric
  estimates ( M_⋆∼1.4_-0.4^+0.3×10^8 M_⊙). Given the predicted BH mass (M_BH~10^7-10^8
  M_⊙), the resulting ratio of M_BH/M_⋆ remains 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher
  than local values, thus lending support to the heavy seeding channel for the formation
  of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.
