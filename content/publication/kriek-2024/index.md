abstract: In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultradeep
  medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at 1.3 < z < 2.3 with
  Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16 hr per band per galaxy,
  we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We
  successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies, and for 19 we also
  measure stellar velocity dispersions (σ_ v ), ages, and elemental abundances, as
  detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line active galactic
  nucleus, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent Hα
  emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint Hα, elevated
  [N II]/Hα suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses (M_dyn)
  by combining σ_ v  with structural parameters obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope
  COSMOS(-DASH) survey and compare them with stellar masses (M_*) derived using spectrophotometric
  modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF),
  we observe a strong correlation between M_dyn/M_* and σ_ v . This correlation may
  suggest that a varying IMF, with high-σ_ v  galaxies being more bottom heavy, was
  already in place at z ∼ 2. When implementing the σ_ v -dependent IMF found in the
  cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in our stellar mass
  and size measurements, we find a low scatter in M_dyn/M_* of 0.14 dex. However,
  these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical
  masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply
  grow inside-out into today's massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more
  complicated.
