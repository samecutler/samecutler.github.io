abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at z gtrsim
  9 found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury
  Program. We confithe redshift via emission lines and/or the Lyα break for 10 galaxies
  at z = 8.50–13.08 down to M_ V  = ‑17.3. We achieve a 100% confirmation rate for
  z > 9 candidates reported in H. Atek et al. Using six sources with multiple line
  detections, we find that offsets in redshift estimates between the lines and the
  Lyα break alone can be ±0.2, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy
  for the break-only sources with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.
  With spec-z-confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits
  on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at z ≃ 9–12 and find
  that these lower limits agree with recent photometric measurements. We identify
  at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems
  based on X-ray, broad Hβ, high ionization lines, and excess in the UV LF. This requires
  the AGN LFs at z ≃ 9–10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated
  at z ∼ 6 and suggests a plausible cause of the high abundance of z > 9 galaxies
  claimed in the recent photometric measurements is AGNs. One UV-luminous source is
  confirmed at the same redshift as a broad-line AGN at z = 8.50 with a physical separation
  of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show emission blueward of Lyα,
  indicating a giant ionized bubble enclosing them with a radius of 7.69 ± 0.18 pMpc.
  Our results imply that AGNs have a nonnegligible contribution to cosmic reionization.
