 abstract = {We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at z
\ensuremath\gtrsim 9 found behind the massive galaxy cluster
Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm
the redshift via emission lines and/or the
Ly\ensuremathα break for 10 galaxies at z =
8.50–13.08 down to M $_ V $ = ‑17.3. We achieve a
100% confirmation rate for z > 9 candidates reported in H. Atek
et al. Using six sources with multiple line detections, we find
that offsets in redshift estimates between the lines and the
Ly\ensuremathα break alone can be
\ensuremath±0.2, raising caution in designing future
follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. With spec-z-
confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower
limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function
(LF) at z ≃ 9–12 and find that these lower limits
agree with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least
two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus
(AGN) systems based on X-ray, broad H\ensuremathβ, high
ionization lines, and excess in the UV LF. This requires the AGN
LFs at z ≃ 9–10 to be comparable or even higher than
the X-ray AGN LF estimated at z \ensuremath∼ 6 and
suggests a plausible cause of the high abundance of z > 9
galaxies claimed in the recent photometric measurements is AGNs.
One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a
broad-line AGN at z = 8.50 with a physical separation of 380 kpc
in the source plane. These two sources show emission blueward of
Ly\ensuremathα, indicating a giant ionized bubble
enclosing them with a radius of 7.69 \ensuremath± 0.18
pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a nonnegligible
contribution to cosmic reionization.},
