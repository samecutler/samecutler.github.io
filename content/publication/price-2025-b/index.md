abstract: With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of
  JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame
  near-infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic
  noon (z ∼ 1‑3). In this paper we leverage the combined Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) and JWST/Hubble Space Telescope coverage in A2744 to study the multiwavelength
  (0.5‑4.4 μm) structures of 11 submillimeter detected galaxies at z ∼ 0.9‑3.5 that
  are fainter than bright ``classical'' submillimeter galaxies, seven of which are
  detected in deep X-ray data. While these objects reveal a diversity of structures
  and sizes, all are smaller and more concentrated toward longer wavelengths. Of the
  X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for appreciable active galactic nucleus
  (AGN) flux contributions (at gtrsim2 μm). Excluding the two AGN-dominated objects,
  the smaller long-wavelength sizes indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles,
  inferred to trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their optical
  profiles. The submillimeter detections and visible dust lanes suggest that centrally
  concentrated dust is a key driver of the observed color gradients. Further, we find
  that more concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame NIR to
  optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions
  also have the most concentrated dust. The 1.2 mm flux densities and size ratios
  of these nine objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry impact
  these galaxies' multiwavelength structures. Upcoming higher-resolution 1.2 mm ALMA
  imaging will facilitate joint spatially resolved analysis and will directly test
  the dust distributions within this representative submillimeter population.
