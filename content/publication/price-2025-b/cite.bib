 abstract = {With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution
of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation
to probe the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR) and stellar
structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z
\ensuremath∼ 1‑3). In this paper we leverage the combined
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and
JWST/Hubble Space Telescope coverage in A2744 to study the
multiwavelength (0.5‑4.4 \ensuremathμm) structures of 11
submillimeter detected galaxies at z \ensuremath∼ 0.9‑3.5
that are fainter than bright ``classical'' submillimeter
galaxies, seven of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While
these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all
are smaller and more concentrated toward longer wavelengths. Of
the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for
appreciable active galactic nucleus (AGN) flux contributions (at
\ensuremath\gtrsim2 \ensuremathμm). Excluding the two
AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long-wavelength sizes
indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to
trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their
optical profiles. The submillimeter detections and visible dust
lanes suggest that centrally concentrated dust is a key driver
of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more
concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame
NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most
compact light distributions also have the most concentrated
dust. The 1.2 mm flux densities and size ratios of these nine
objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry
impact these galaxies' multiwavelength structures. Upcoming
higher-resolution 1.2 mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint
spatially resolved analysis and will directly test the dust
distributions within this representative submillimeter
population.},
