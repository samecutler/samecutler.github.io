abstract: In 2022 November, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep near-infrared
  images of A2744-a powerful lensing cluster capable of magnifying distant, incipient
  galaxies beyond it. Together with existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging,
  this publicly available data set opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand
  the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic
  time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin^2
  JWST footprint down to a 5σ limiting magnitude of~30 mag in 0.″32 apertures. Photometry
  is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point-spread function
  (PSF) of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies
  and the related intracluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance,
  we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a σ_NMAD ≈ 0.03 based on known, but
  relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our
  HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes
  for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame
  colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage
  for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow up of some of the first JWST-selected
  samples in summer of 2023.
