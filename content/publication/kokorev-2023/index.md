abstract: Deep observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed
  an emerging population of red pointlike sources that could provide a link between
  the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work,
  we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey
  of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying a clear broad-line component
  as inferred from the Hβ line with FWHM = 3439 ± 413 km s^-1, typical of the broad-line
  region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further
  supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source
  morphology. We compute a black hole mass of log_10(M_BH/M_⊙)=8.17± 0.42 and a bolometric
  luminosity of L_bol~6.6 × 10^45 erg s^-1. These values imply that our object is
  accreting at~40% of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy
  distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA,
  indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of log_10(M_* /M_⊙) 8.7 , which would
  lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least~30%. This
  is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with recent
  AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a nonnegligible
  fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or
  grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities
  of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us
  to further investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.
