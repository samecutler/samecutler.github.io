abstract: We present the H-band morphological catalogs for the COSMOS-DASH
  survey, the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing the
  "Drift And SHift" observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH
  survey imaged approximately 0.5 square degrees of the UltraVISTA deep stripes
  (0.7 sq. deg. when combined with archival data). Global structural parameters
  are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT (excluding
  the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-band HST image. We recover
  consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs,
  finding that, in general, sizes and Sérsic indices of typical galaxies are
  accurate to limiting magnitudes of H<23 and H<22 ABmag, respectively. In
  size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust
  morphological measurements out to z∼2 and down to logM∼9. With the advantage
  of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent
  size-mass relation below logM∼10.5 that persists out to z∼2. We show that
  environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to
  z=1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural
  evolution.
