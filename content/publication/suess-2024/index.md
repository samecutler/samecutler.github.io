abstract: In this paper, we describe the ``Medium Bands, Mega Science'' JWST Cycle
  2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data to reveal both the
  spatially integrated and spatially resolved properties of galaxies from the local
  Universe to the era of cosmic dawn. Executed in 2023 November, MegaScience obtained
  ∼30 arcmin^2 of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z ∼ 0.3 A2744 cluster,
  including 11 medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broadband filters,
  F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program
  provide a complete set of deep (∼28–30 mag_AB) images in all NIRCam medium- and
  broadband filters. This unique data set allows us to precisely constrain photometric
  redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant
  galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories.
  MegaScience also includes ∼17 arcmin^2 of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broadband
  and four medium-band filters from 0.9 to 4.8 μm, expanding the footprint where robust
  spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs
  and multiband cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic
  redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier
  rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2–3. Additionally, we demonstrate the
  spatially resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [O III]
  line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically confirmed z > 6
  galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy,
  extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly
  histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced
  mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel
  fields (jwst-uncover.github.io/megascience).
