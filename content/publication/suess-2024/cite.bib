 abstract = {In this paper, we describe the ``Medium Bands, Mega Science'' JWST Cycle
2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data
to reveal both the spatially integrated and spatially resolved
properties of galaxies from the local Universe to the era of
cosmic dawn. Executed in 2023 November, MegaScience obtained
\ensuremath∼30 arcmin$^2$ of deep multiband NIRCam
imaging centered on the z \ensuremath∼ 0.3 A2744 cluster,
including 11 medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength
broadband filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and
the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of
deep (\ensuremath∼28–30 mag$_AB$) images in
all NIRCam medium- and broadband filters. This unique data set
allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map
stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of
distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy
structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes
\ensuremath∼17 arcmin$^2$ of NIRISS parallel imaging in
two broadband and four medium-band filters from 0.9 to 4.8
\ensuremathμm, expanding the footprint where robust
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We
provide example SEDs and multiband cutouts at a variety of
redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to
show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic
outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of
2–3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially
resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of
the [O III] line emission and continuum emission in three
spectroscopically confirmed z > 6 galaxies. We show that line
emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended,
and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that
galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early
epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and
photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS
parallel fields (jwst-uncover.github.io/megascience).},
