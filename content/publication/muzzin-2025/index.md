abstract: 'We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and
  127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
  MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M,
  F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of
  the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields
  were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS
  and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5σ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers ∼
  542 arcmin^2, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least
  8 bands by ∼ 7times. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5σ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and
  covers ∼ 275 arcmin^2 in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging,
  these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending
  on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed
  breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous
  observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project.
  These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband
  catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by
  factors of rsim 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1
  < z < 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep
  field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood
  completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating
  spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.'
