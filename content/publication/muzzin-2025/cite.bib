 abstract = {We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and
127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam
medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M,
F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four
of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and
GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7
- 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs.
MINERVA reaches a 5$σ$ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers
$∼$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the area of existing JWST
medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $∼$ 7$\times$.
The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$σ$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and
covers $∼$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When
combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a
photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field)
and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a
detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and
field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an
overview of the primary science goals of the project. These
include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in
current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar
mass functions and number densities by factors of $rsim$ 3, and
resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$
6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the
treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving
population studies with well-understood completeness, robust
photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and
facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.},
