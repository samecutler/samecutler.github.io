abstract: Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start
  as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies.
  The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, suggested
  by recent observations, appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would
  require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge
  in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming
  stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been
  challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we
  report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the
  quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z=4.896, 1.2 billion years after the
  Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the galaxy's
  stellar mass of 10^10.9 M_âŠ™, corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics,
  formed in a short 340Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity
  dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models,
  systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to
  plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the
  discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be
  quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than
  currently assumed.
