 abstract = {In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec
and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization
(UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program, which executed its
early imaging component in 2022 November. The UNCOVER survey
includes ultradeep (\ensuremath∼29–30AB)
imaging of \ensuremath∼45 arcmin$^2$ on and around the
well-studied A2744 galaxy cluster at z = 0.308 and will follow
up \ensuremath∼500 galaxies with extremely deep low-
resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer
of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the
science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data
releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the
first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously
unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2–4
\ensuremathμm imaging of known objects in the field. The
UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin$^2$ in seven
filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W)
and 16.8 arcmin$^2$ in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W,
F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early community use of the
Treasury data set, we publicly release the full reduced mosaics
of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin$^2$ NIRCam and 17
arcmin$^2$ NIRISS mosaics on and around the A2744 cluster,
including the Hubble Frontier Field primary and parallel
footprints.},
