abstract: "With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution\
  \ of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the\
  \ rest-frame near infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies\
  \ at cosmic noon (zåisebox-0.5ex~1-3). In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA\
  \ and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4um) structures\
  \ of 11 sub- millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at zi̊sebox-0.5ex~0.9-3.5 that\
  \ are fainter than bright ``classical'' sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). While these objects\
  \ reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all exhibit decreasing sizes and increasing\
  \ central concentration towards longer wavelengths. The smaller sizes of these objects\
  \ at long wavelengths indicate that their stellar mass profiles are more compact\
  \ than their optical light profiles, likely due to centrally-concentrated dust obscuration.\
  \ Further, we find that galaxies with higher central concentration values tend to\
  \ have more extreme size ratios (comparing the rest-frame NIR to rest- frame optical);\
  \ this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also\
  \ have the most concentrated dust distributions. We also find the galaxies with\
  \ the most extreme size ratios do not have elevated 1.2mm flux densities compared\
  \ to the rest of our sample: we argue this means compact dust geometry, rather than\
  \ e.g. high total dust quantity, drives the most extreme observed rest-frame NIR-to-optical\
  \ size ratios. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint\
  \ spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within\
  \ this representative sub-mm population."
