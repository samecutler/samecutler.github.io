abstract: "With the recent discovery of ``The Sparkler'', JWST has opened up uncharted
  parameter space in the distant universe: remarkable high resolution views of ancient
  globular cluster (GC) candidates. There exists another fascinating galaxy in the
  Abell 2744 lensing cluster at even higher redshift that is littered with compact
  red and blue star-forming complexes - ``The Relic''. Here, we will present the discovery
  of the Relic, a bright, quenched galaxy at z=2.5, existing merely a few billion
  years after the Big Bang. These compact star-forming complexes are potential GC
  candidates, with the red ones consistent with ancient relics with formation times
  as early as z~10, while the blue ones may be caught early in their formation. If
  these candidates survive to the present day, they would have ages ranging from 11
  to 13 billion years. Based on a photometric analysis that includes recently acquired
  ultra-deep medium-band photometry, we present an overview of the stellar population
  properties of these GC candidates as a function of their projected distance, using
  this to assess their probabilities of surviving relative to being disrupted and
  contributing to bulge formation."
