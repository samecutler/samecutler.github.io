 abstract = {With the recent discovery of ``The Sparkler'', JWST has opened up
uncharted parameter space in the distant universe: remarkable
high resolution views of ancient globular cluster (GC)
candidates. There exists another fascinating galaxy in the Abell
2744 lensing cluster at even higher redshift that is littered
with compact red and blue star-forming complexes - ``The
Relic''. Here, we will present the discovery of the Relic, a
bright, quenched galaxy at z=2.5, existing merely a few billion
years after the Big Bang. These compact star-forming complexes
are potential GC candidates, with the red ones consistent with
ancient relics with formation times as early as
z√•isebox-0.5ex~10, while the blue ones may be
caught early in their formation. If these candidates survive to
the present day, they would have ages ranging from 11 to 13
billion years. Based on a photometric analysis that includes
recently acquired ultra-deep medium-band photometry, we present
an overview of the stellar population properties of these GC
candidates as a function of their projected distance, using this
to assess their probabilities of surviving relative to being
disrupted and contributing to bulge formation.},
