 abstract = {We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between
$0.5<z<3,$ tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both
effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength
JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light
radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455
quiescent galaxies with log($M_*/M_ødot$)$>10$, whereas half-
mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the
F277W-F444W color-$M_*$/L relation. We investigate the
dependence of the ratio $r_e, \mathrmmass/r_e,
\mathrmlight$ on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength
used to measure $r_e, \mathrmlight$, also separating the
sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data
demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace
mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical
wavelengths (0.5-0.7$μ$m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only
minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of
young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent
galaxies at intermediate masses, $10<$log($M_*/M_ødot$)$<11$,
within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame
half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius
measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination
of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of
intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $0.5<z<3$. Our results
further indicate that the varying contributions to the general
quiescent population by young and old quiescent galaxies can
mimic evolution in redshift.},
