abstract: We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (UV) morphology of galaxies
  in the first billion years of the Universe. Using James Webb Space Telescope data
  from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster A2744, we
  present multiband morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected
  using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the
  redshift range of 4 < z < 8. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using
  pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in six NIRCam wide filters covering
  the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision
  of measured radii by 50%. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sérsic indices,
  with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size–mass
  relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift
  evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average
  size of galaxies at logM*/M⊙=8.5 grows rapidly, from 400 pc at z = 8 to 830 pc at
  z = 4. This is faster evolution than expected from power-law scalings of the Hubble
  parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at z < 2. This suggests
  that different and/or much stronger processes affect low-mass systems during the
  epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex)
  are nonevolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter
  over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy–halo connection.
