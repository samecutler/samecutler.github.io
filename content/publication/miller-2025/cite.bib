 abstract = {We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (UV) morphology of
galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using James
Webb Space Telescope data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience
surveys targeting the lensing cluster A2744, we present
multiband morphological measurements for a sample of 995
galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using
NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of 4 < z < 8.
The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic
by simultaneously modeling the images in six NIRCam wide filters
covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling
technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50%.
Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sérsic indices,
with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology.
We model the size–mass relation in a Bayesian manner
using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution
while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the
average size of galaxies at logM*/M\ensuremathødot=8.5
grows rapidly, from 400 pc at z = 8 to 830 pc at z = 4. This is
faster evolution than expected from power-law scalings of the
Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous
results at z < 2. This suggests that different and/or much
stronger processes affect low-mass systems during the epoch of
reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter
(0.23 dex) are nonevolving. We discuss the remarkable
consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the
context of the galaxy–halo connection.},
