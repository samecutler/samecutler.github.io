 abstract = {We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to
measure emission line fluxes and study the dust and star
formation properties of galaxies at cosmic noon. In this work,
we present photometric emission line measurements and spatially
resolved maps of H\ensuremathα and
Pa\ensuremathβ for 14 galaxies at 1.3
\ensuremathłeq z \ensuremathłeq 2.4, observed by the
MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER spectroscopic
survey. We measure line fluxes directly from medium-band
photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from
UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric
and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both
H\ensuremathα and Pa\ensuremathβ, with scatter
<0.15 dex down to emission line equivalent widths of 10 ̊A.
We also make a nebular dust measurement from the ratio
Pa\ensuremathβ/H\ensuremathα, finding an
average nebular attenuation in the V band, A$_V$, of 1.4 with
a standard deviation of 0.8. Our photometric A$_V$
measurements show a slightly larger scatter of 0.5 mag when
compared to spectroscopic measurements; however, this scatter
may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce
spatially resolved maps of H\ensuremathα emission,
Pa\ensuremathβ emission, and the stellar continuum. We
find offsets between H\ensuremathα and
Pa\ensuremathβ emission, especially for galaxies with
high A$_V$, indicating dusty substructures. Furthermore, the
correlation between H\ensuremathα and continuum
emission decreases with increasing A$_V$, suggesting that the
dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star formation
distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band
photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star
formation, and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in
UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in upcoming JWST medium-band
surveys.},
