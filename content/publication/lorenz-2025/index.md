abstract: We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to measure
  emission line fluxes and study the dust and star formation properties of galaxies
  at cosmic noon. In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements
  and spatially resolved maps of Hα and Paβ for 14 galaxies at 1.3 leq z leq 2.4,
  observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER spectroscopic survey.
  We measure line fluxes directly from medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic
  measurements from UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric
  and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both Hα and Paβ, with scatter <0.15 dex
  down to emission line equivalent widths of 10 ̊A. We also make a nebular dust measurement
  from the ratio Paβ/Hα, finding an average nebular attenuation in the V band, A_V,
  of 1.4 with a standard deviation of 0.8. Our photometric A_V measurements show a
  slightly larger scatter of 0.5 mag when compared to spectroscopic measurements;
  however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce
  spatially resolved maps of Hα emission, Paβ emission, and the stellar continuum.
  We find offsets between Hα and Paβ emission, especially for galaxies with high A_V,
  indicating dusty substructures. Furthermore, the correlation between Hα and continuum
  emission decreases with increasing A_V, suggesting that the dustiest objects have
  clumpy dust and star formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of
  medium-band photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation,
  and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies
  in upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.
