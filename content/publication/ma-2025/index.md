abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z ≈ 5–8 dubbed
  ``little red dots'' (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed
  by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic
  V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of
  the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the
  UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission
  lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN
  or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst
  galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being subdominant
  at all wavelengths and contributing at a level of ∼20%. However, this model infers
  a stellar mass of M_⋆ ≈ 4 × 10^9 M_⊙ within a radius of r_e < 30 pc, driving its
  central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density
  could be explained if A2744-QSO1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive
  elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models
  also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction law to preserve the strong break
  strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains.
  It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's
  true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle
  the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations
  could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs. *The error code 404 in the title
  represents that no satisfying model is found for A2744-QSO 1. In computer network
  communication, the code ``404'' refers to the error occurring when the server cannot
  find the requested information.
