 abstract = {JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z
\ensuremath≈ 5–8 dubbed ``little red
dots'' (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum
followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study
of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs
remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM
spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the
UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and
broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to
explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar
contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a
post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a
reddened AGN being subdominant at all wavelengths and
contributing at a level of \ensuremath∼20%. However,
this model infers a stellar mass of M$_\ensuremath⋆$
\ensuremath≈ 4 × 10$^9$
M$_\ensuremathødot$ within a radius of r$_e$ < 30 pc,
driving its central density to the highest among observations to
date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO1
is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical
galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel.
The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction
law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness
may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also
probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of
A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation
mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN
contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations
could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs. *The error code
404 in the title represents that no satisfying model is found
for A2744-QSO 1. In computer network communication, the code
``404'' refers to the error occurring when the server cannot
find the requested information.},
