abstract: We present the survey design and initial results of the ALMA Cycle 9 program
  of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting
  the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744. DUALZ features a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide
  mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of μ>2 down to a sensitivity of σ=32.7 μJy. Through
  a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N rsim5.0 with median
  redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_ 1.2mm^ int=0.24. Of these, 27
  have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations,
  while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam,
  and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158
  μm line emitter at z=6.3254±0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy.
  The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies,
  denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission
  are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W>27mag,
  F150W-F444W>2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W>30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA
  continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial
  dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal
  dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z_ spec=10.07, suggesting an active
  co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity
  function up to z∼10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation
  models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release
  reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.
