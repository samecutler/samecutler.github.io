abstract: 'We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation at
  Cosmic Noon (1<z<3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlight
  two distinct classes of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well
  studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously under-explored
  due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution
  (in the rest-frame near-IR). We select a conservative sample of robust low-mass
  quiescent galaxy candidates using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation
  rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths
  (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous “flattening”
  of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation, which results from the separation
  of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct populations at log(M_⋆/M_⊙)∼10.3:
  low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and have disky structures,
  and massive galaxies with prolate morphologies and older median stellar ages. These
  separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the massive end while other
  mechanisms, such as environmental or feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass
  end. This stellar mass dependent slope of the quiescent size-mass relation could
  also indicate a shift from size growth due to star formation (low masses) to growth
  via mergers (massive galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations
  also corresponds with other dramatic changes in galaxy evolutions (e.g. star-formation
  efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-halo mass ratios), further highlighting
  the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy formation.'
