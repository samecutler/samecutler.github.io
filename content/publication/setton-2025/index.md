abstract: Luminous broad Hα emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of
  compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or
  obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has
  proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models.
  Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and
  archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z=3.1
  and z=4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date.
  The detections at lambda_rest=1-4  μm imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out
  a contribution from hot (Trsim500 K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out
  any appreciable cold (Tlesssim75 K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these
  observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts
  and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally,
  our [C_II] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical
  maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have log(L_IR/L_⊙) lesssim 12.2 at
  the 3σ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric
  fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are
  highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution
  that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically
  redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.
