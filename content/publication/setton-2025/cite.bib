 abstract = {Luminous broad H$α$ emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the
hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly
attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic
nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved
difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in
these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and
existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel
imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and
$z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR
luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at
$łambda_\mathrmrest=1-4 \ μ$m imply flat slopes in the
rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($Trsim500$ K) dust.
Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold
($Tłesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these
observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission
of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a
mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our
[$\mathrmC_II$] non-detections rule out typical dusty
starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that
both LRDs must have $łog(L_\mathrmIR/L_ødot) łesssim 12.2$
at the $3σ$ level. These limits are in tension with the
predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they
galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs
are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust
temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current
observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder
LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust
attenuation.},
