@article{Pan2025,
 abstract = {Environmental quenching -- where interactions with other galaxies and/or
the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-
mass galaxies -- has long been proposed as the primary driver to
establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters
at low redshift ($z<1$). However, we still do not know whether
these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at
higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to
fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained
unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James
Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the
role of environmental quenching on low-mass
(log(M$_⋆$/M$_ødot$)$<$9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon ($2
< z < 3$). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and
MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental
quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered $z≈
2.6$ overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R $∼$ 15
spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze
the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories
(SFHs) of 20 low-mass
(8.5$<$log(M$_⋆$/M$_ødot$)$łeq$9.0) quiescent galaxies
in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of
18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in
the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar
mass regime (8.5$<$log(M$_⋆$/M$_ødot$)$łeq$11.0) are
indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic
noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field.
This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at
$z>2$ have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough
environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.},
