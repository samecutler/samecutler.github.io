 abstract = {Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in
overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to
explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale
quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the
intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster
galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing
the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass
quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at $z<0.5$. Using
spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience
programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent
size-mass relation between $7<łog(M_⋆/M_ødot)<10$ using
JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1531 galaxies in the
$z=0.308$ Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass
relation has a significantly higher scatter than similar-
redshift field samples, despite comparable best-fit relations in
both the dwarf and intermediate-mass regimes. Both ``progenitor
bias'', where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the
cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy
structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This
evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative
evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster
are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for
our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs
relatively late, at $z<1.5$. In this scenario, the progenitor
population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic
noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves
ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and
drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-
quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the
environment.},
