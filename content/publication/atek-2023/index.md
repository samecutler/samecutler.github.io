abstract: Low-mass galaxies in the early universe are believed to be the building
  blocks of present-day galaxies. These fledgling systems likely played a pivotal
  role in cosmic reionization, a major phase transition from neutral Hydrogen to ionized
  plasma around 600-800 Myr after the Big Bang. However, these galaxies have eluded
  comprehensive spectroscopic studies owing to their extreme faintness. Here we report
  the first spectroscopic analysis of 8 ultra-faint galaxies during the epoch of reionization
  with absolute magnitudes between M$_m̊ UV$ $∼ -17$ to $-15$ mag (down to 0.005 $L^⋆$).
  The combination of ultra-deep NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) observations
  and the strong gravitational lensing boost of Abelli̊sebox-0.5ex~2744 allow us to
  derive the first spectroscopic constraints on the prevalence of faint galaxies and
  their ionizing properties during the Universe's first billion years. We find that
  faint galaxies are prodigious producers of ionizing photons with log($ξ_ri̊on$/
  Hz erg$^-1$) =$25.8± 0.05$, a factor of 4 larger than canonical values. This means
  that the total rate of ionizing photons produced by galaxies exceeds that needed
  for reionization, even for modest values of escape fraction ($f_rms̊c$ =5%). These
  findings provide robust evidence that faint galaxies were the main drivers of cosmic
  reionization at $z∼7$.
