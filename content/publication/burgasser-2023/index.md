abstract: We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified
  in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization
  (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported
  as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while the two other sources
  were initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Ultradeep, low-resolution
  1-5 μm spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf
  atmospheres, and comparison to near-infrared spectral standards infers spectral
  classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8-T9. The spectrum of the warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1,
  shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and a fit to atmosphere models indicates
  Teff = 1300 K and [M/H]~-1.0, making this one of the few examples of a spectroscopically-confirmed
  T subdwarf. The spectrum of the coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, places it near the
  T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and we identify features of CH_4, CO, H_2O,
  and likely PH_3 in the 3.5-5.0 μm band. Our analysis suggests that PH3 is favored
  over CO_2 in this source, a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate
  distances of 0.9-4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, and population simulations
  indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk or halo. Our
  simulations also indicate that there may be up to 7 T dwarfs and 5-6 L dwarfs in
  the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly half of which are halo members.
  These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying
  and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.
