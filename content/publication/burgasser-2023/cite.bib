 abstract = {We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs
identified in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations
before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell
2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported as a
candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while the
two other sources were initially identified as candidate active
galactic nuclei. Ultradeep, low-resolution 1-5 $μ$m spectra
confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T
dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to near-infrared spectral
standards infers spectral classifications of sdT1, T6, and
T8-T9. The spectrum of the warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows
evidence of subsolar metallicity, and a fit to atmosphere models
indicates Teff = 1300 K and [M/H]
åisebox-0.5ex~ -1.0, making this one of the
few examples of a spectroscopically-confirmed T subdwarf. The
spectrum of the coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, places it near the
T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and we identify features
of CH$_4$, CO, H$_2$O, and likely PH$_3$ in the 3.5-5.0 $μ$m
band. Our analysis suggests that PH3 is favored over CO$_2$ in
this source, a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We
estimate distances of 0.9-4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane,
and population simulations indicate high probabilities of
membership in the Galactic thick disk or halo. Our simulations
also indicate that there may be up to 7 T dwarfs and 5-6 L
dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag,
roughly half of which are halo members. These results highlight
the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying
and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the
Milky Way.},
