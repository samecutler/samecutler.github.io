abstract: Understanding the history of star formation in galaxies is key to gaining
  a more comprehensive picture of galaxy formation, evolution, and quenching. However,
  a significant amount of photometric and/or spectroscopic data is necessary to robustly
  model the non-parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies. Semi-resolved
  SFHs also require the photometry and spectroscopy to be spatially resolved, which
  limits the use of longer-wavelength data. We present a study of the semi-resolved,
  2-component SFHs of 60 zåisebox-0.5ex~2 main- sequence, star-forming galaxies in
  the GOODS-N field, modeled using the Prospector code with a novel iterative method
  to incorporate unresolved K-band/IRAC data. Our results suggest that selecting star-forming
  galaxies at cosmic noon may frequently include systems in an ``evolved'' evolutionary
  phase where the centers have recently started a burst of star- formation activity
  that will likely initiate inside-out quenching in the next several hundred million
  years. Due to the extensive data sets required to model resolved SFHs, we also develop
  a model to match observed F814W-F160W color gradients from 3D-DASH and COSMOS/ACS
  imaging to quenching and formation timescales of quenched galaxies at zi̊sebox-0.5ex~2.
  These timescales provide an overview of the galaxies' formation time (early or late)
  and quenching speed (fast or slow), suggesting that the overall evolutionary history
  of these quenched galaxies at this epoch can be inferred using semi-revolved color
  gradients.
