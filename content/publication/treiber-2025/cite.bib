 abstract = {JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift (z
\ensuremath∼ 4–11) active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current
photoionization models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV
emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other
exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies
predominantly focused on broad-line AGNs. From a parent sample
of 205 z$_spec$ > 3 UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM
follow-up, we identify 12 galaxies with C IV, He II, and/or C
III] emission. Three of these galaxies also exhibit clear N III]
and/or N IV] lines. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and UV
coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using
the sample's [O III]/H\ensuremathβ distribution,
significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star
formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the
five He II emitters are the strongest AGN candidates, with
further support from two [Ne V] detections and one X-ray
detection from Chandra. Our Balmer line fits also reveal one new
broad-line AGN at z = 6.87. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN
fraction in this sample, but we note that close to 20% of
M$_*$ > 2 × 10$^9$ M$_\ensuremathødot$
parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates. The lower-mass line
emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming
photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher
specific star formation rates than the parent sample. Higher-
resolution and deeper data on these UV line emitters should
provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction
at z > 3.},
