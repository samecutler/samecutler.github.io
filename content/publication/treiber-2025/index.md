abstract: JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift (z ∼ 4–11) active
  galactic nuclei (AGNs) and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current
  photoionization models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics
  to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing
  previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGNs. From a parent sample
  of 205 z_spec > 3 UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM follow-up, we identify 12
  galaxies with C IV, He II, and/or C III] emission. Three of these galaxies also
  exhibit clear N III] and/or N IV] lines. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and
  UV coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using the sample's
  [O III]/Hβ distribution, significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star
  formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the five He II emitters
  are the strongest AGN candidates, with further support from two [Ne V] detections
  and one X-ray detection from Chandra. Our Balmer line fits also reveal one new broad-line
  AGN at z = 6.87. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN fraction in this sample, but
  we note that close to 20% of M_* > 2 × 10^9 M_⊙ parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates.
  The lower-mass line emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming
  photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher specific star formation
  rates than the parent sample. Higher-resolution and deeper data on these UV line
  emitters should provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction at
  z > 3.
