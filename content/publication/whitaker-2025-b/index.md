abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe,
  holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However,
  accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity
  degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the
  'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at z=2.53. The Relic resides in an over-density
  behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two
  low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys,
  we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to ∼2 Gyr, suggesting
  a rich formation history starting at z∼10. While the cluster-based star formation
  history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from
  the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative ∼2-3times
  higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the
  spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate
  age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters
  in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, ∼10^6-10^7~M_⊙,
  which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger
  galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the
  most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection
  between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering
  insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy
  assembly.
