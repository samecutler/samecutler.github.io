 abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the
Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation
and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of
ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity
degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar
systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at
$z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell
2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two
low-mass companions. Using deep data from the
UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed
in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $∼2$ Gyr,
suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z∼10$. While
the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent
with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse
host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative
$∼2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the
past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low
inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age
clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of
star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The
cluster masses are high, $∼10^6-10^7~M_ødot$, which may
explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-
merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with
being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This
unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-
lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations,
offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the
broader processes of galaxy assembly.},
