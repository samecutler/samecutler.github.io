abstract: We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified
  in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization
  (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported
  as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while two sources were
  initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Low-resolution 1–5 μm
  spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres,
  and comparison to spectral standards infers classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8–T9.
  The warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and atmosphere
  model fits indicate T_eff = 1300 K and [M/H] ∼ ‑1.0, making this one of the few
  spectroscopically confirmed T subdwarfs known. The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3,
  is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with T_eff = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the
  presence of PH_3 in the 3–5 μm region, favored over CO_2 and a possible indicator
  of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9–4.5 kpc from the Galactic
  midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation.
  Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic
  thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1.
  Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1–2 L dwarfs
  in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are
  thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy
  for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky
  Way.
