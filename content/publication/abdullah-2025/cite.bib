 abstract = {The morphologies of quiescent galaxies provide insight into the physical
processes that shut down star formation. Recent studies with
JWST find that low mass quiescent galaxies have a lower
Sérsic index and more disk-like morphologies relative to
massive quenched galaxies, suggesting that the formation and
quenching pathways of low and high mass galaxies are different.
Owing to random viewing angles, a galaxy can have a range of
observable axis ratios depending on its orientation. It is
therefore necessary to consider the full distribution of axis
ratios at a population level. Using JWST/NIRCam rest-optical
imaging from the PRIMER survey, we analyze the intrinsic axis
ratio distributions of 154 quiescent galaxies at 1<z<3 by
considering pure populations (thin/thick disk, prolate,
spheroidal) and linear combinations therein. We determine that
more massive, older quiescent galaxies are mostly spheroid,
whereas lower mass, younger quiescent galaxies are consistent
with disky and prolate morphologies. These findings are well
aligned with those inferred based on Sérsic index alone and
are consistent with models where internal feedback drives
quenching on the high mass end whereas environmental quenching
is dominant in low mass galaxies. We are working on a similar
analysis for star forming galaxies to assess our theories of
quenching pathways for these two distinct populations.},
