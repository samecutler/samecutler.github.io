abstract: Early JWST observations have uncovered a new, substantial population of
  red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of actively growing
  supermassive black holes (Kocevski et al. 2023, Matthee et al. 2023, Labbe et al.
  2023). One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object
  that was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744
  (Furtak et al. 2023), allowing an unprecedented detailed look into this enigmatic
  population. Here we present deep spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec observations of this
  object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the
  same object, and that it is a highly reddened ($A_V∼3$) broad emission-line Active
  Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at a redshift of $z_mathrmspec=7.0451±0.0005$. From the width
  of H$β$ ($mathrmFWHM=2800±250,fracmathrmkmmathrms$) we derive a black hole mass
  of $M_mathrmBH=3_-1^+2times10^7,mathrmM_ødot$. We infer a very high ratio of black
  hole to galaxy mass of at least 3% and possibly as high as 100%, an order of magnitude
  or more than is seen in local galaxies. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum
  together with the high bolometric luminosity ($L _mathrmbol=(1.1±0.3)times10^45,fracmathrmergm
  athrms$) suggest that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting
  at 30% of the Eddington limit. Based on early JWST imaging studies we estimate that
  such heavily reddened, low-mass black holes can be $∼100$ times more common than
  UV-selected ones at this epoch. The rapid growth and high black hole to galaxy mass
  ratio of A2744-QSO1 suggests that it may represent the missing link between black
  hole seeds (Inayoshi et al. 2020; Greene et al. 2020; Volonteri 2021) and the first
  luminous quasars (Fan et al. 2023).
