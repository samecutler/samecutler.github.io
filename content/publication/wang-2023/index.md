abstract: 'Observations of high-redshift galaxies provide a critical direct test to
  the theories of early galaxy formation, yet to date, only three have been spectroscopically
  confirmed at z > 12. Due to strong gravitational lensing over a wide area, the galaxy
  cluster field A2744 is ideal for searching for the earliest galaxies. Here we present
  JWST/NIRSpec observations of two galaxies: a robust detection at z_spec=12.393_-0.001^+0.004
  , and a plausible candidate at z_spec=13.079_-0.001^+0.013 . The galaxies are discovered
  in JWST/NIRCam imaging and their distances are inferred with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy,
  all from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey. Detailed stellar population modeling
  using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data corroborates the primeval characteristics of
  these galaxies: low mass (~10^8 M_⊙), young, rapidly assembling, metal-poor, and
  star-forming. Interestingly, both galaxies are spatially resolved, having lensing-corrected
  rest-UV effective radii on the order of 300-400 pc, which are notably larger than
  other spectroscopically confirmed systems at similar redshifts. The observed dynamic
  range of z gtrsim 10 sizes spans over 1 order of magnitude, implying a significant
  scatter in the size-mass relation at early times. Deep into the epoch of reionization,
  these discoveries elucidate the emergence of the first galaxies.'
