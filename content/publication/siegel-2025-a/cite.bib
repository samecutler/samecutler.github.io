 abstract = {We explore the physical properties of five massive quiescent galaxies at
z \ensuremath∼ 2.5, revealing the presence of
nonnegligible dust reservoirs. JWST NIRSpec observations were
obtained for each target, finding no significant line emission;
multiple star formation tracers independently place upper limits
between 0.1 and 10 M$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^‑1$.
Spectral energy distribution modeling with Prospector infers
stellar masses of
log10[M/M\ensuremathødot]\ensuremath∼10‑11 and
stellar-mass-weighted ages between 1 and 2 Gyr. The inferred
mass-weighted effective radii (r$_eff$ \ensuremath∼
0.4–1.4 kpc) and inner 1 kpc stellar surface
densities (log10[\ensuremathΣ1kpc/M\ensuremathødot
kpc2]\ensuremath\gtrsim9) are typical of quiescent galaxies
at z \ensuremath\gtrsim 2. The galaxies predominately
display negative color gradients (redder core and bluer
outskirts); for one galaxy, this effect results from a dusty
core. Unlike local quiescent galaxies, we identify significant
reddening in these typical cosmic noon passive galaxies; all but
one require A$_V$ \ensuremath\gtrsim 0.4. This finding is
in qualitative agreement with previous studies, but our deep
20-band NIRCam imaging is able to significantly suppress the
dust–age degeneracy and confidently determine that
these galaxies are reddened. We speculate about the physical
effects that may drive the decline in dust content in quiescent
galaxies over cosmic time.},
