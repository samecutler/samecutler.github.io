abstract: We explore the physical properties of five massive quiescent galaxies at
  z ∼ 2.5, revealing the presence of nonnegligible dust reservoirs. JWST NIRSpec observations
  were obtained for each target, finding no significant line emission; multiple star
  formation tracers independently place upper limits between 0.1 and 10 M_⊙ yr^‑1.
  Spectral energy distribution modeling with Prospector infers stellar masses of log10[M/M⊙]∼10‑11
  and stellar-mass-weighted ages between 1 and 2 Gyr. The inferred mass-weighted effective
  radii (r_eff ∼ 0.4–1.4 kpc) and inner 1 kpc stellar surface densities (log10[Σ1kpc/M⊙
  kpc2]gtrsim9) are typical of quiescent galaxies at z gtrsim 2. The galaxies predominately
  display negative color gradients (redder core and bluer outskirts); for one galaxy,
  this effect results from a dusty core. Unlike local quiescent galaxies, we identify
  significant reddening in these typical cosmic noon passive galaxies; all but one
  require A_V gtrsim 0.4. This finding is in qualitative agreement with previous studies,
  but our deep 20-band NIRCam imaging is able to significantly suppress the dust–age
  degeneracy and confidently determine that these galaxies are reddened. We speculate
  about the physical effects that may drive the decline in dust content in quiescent
  galaxies over cosmic time.
