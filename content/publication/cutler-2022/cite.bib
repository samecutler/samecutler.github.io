 abstract = {We present the H $_160$ morphological catalogs for the COSMOS-DASH
survey, the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date.
Utilizing the ``Drift And SHift'' observing technique for HST-
WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5
deg$^2$ of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 deg$^2$, when
combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are
measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT
(excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-
band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from
the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in
general, sizes and Sérsic indices of typical galaxies are
accurate to limiting magnitudes of H $_160$ < 23 and H
$_160$ < 22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space,
galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological
measurements out to z åisebox-0.5ex~ 2 and
down to $\mathrmlog(M_⋆ /M_ødot )∼ 9$ . With
the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a
flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below
$\mathrmlog(M_⋆ /M_ødot )∼ 10.5$ that persists
out to z \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 2. We show that
environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at
least out to z = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may
instead govern the structural evolution.},
