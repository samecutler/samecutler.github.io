abstract: We present a study of spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs)
  for 60 z ~ 2.3 main-sequence, star-forming galaxies selected from the MOSDEF spectroscopic
  survey in the GOODS-N field, with median stellar mass log(M_⋆/M_⊙ ) = 9.75 and spanning
  the range 8.6 log(M_⋆/M_⊙ ) 11.5 . Photometry is decomposed into a central and an
  outer spatial component using observed z_F850LP - H_F160W colors. The PROSPECTOR
  code is used to model spectral energy distributions for the center, outskirt, and
  integrated galaxy using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS and WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based
  photometry, with additional constraints on gas-phase metallicity and spectroscopic
  redshift from MOSDEF spectroscopy. For the low-resolution bands, spatially resolved
  photometry is determined with an iterative approach. The reconstructed SFHs indicate
  that the majority of galaxies with log(M_⋆/M_⊙ ) 10.5 are observed while their central
  regions undergo relatively recent (<100 Myr) bursts of star formation, whereas the
  outskirts have a smooth, quasi-steady SFH that gently increases toward the redshift
  of observation. The enhanced star formation activity of the central parts is broadly
  consistent with the idea that it is produced by highly dissipative gas compaction
  and accretion. The wide range of central densities and sizes observed in the sample
  suggests that, for the selected galaxies, such a process has started but is still
  far from being completed. The implication would be that selecting star-forming galaxies
  at cosmic noon frequently includes systems in an ``evolved'' evolutionary phase
  where the centers have recently started a burst of star formation activity that
  will likely initiate inside-out quenching in the next several hundred million years.
