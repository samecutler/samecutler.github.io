 abstract = {In this letter, we measure the rest-frame optical and near-infrared
sizes of ten quiescent candidates at 3<z<5, first reported by
Carnell et al. (2023a). We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) F277W and F444W imaging obtained
through the public CEERS Early Release Science (ERS) program and
imcascade, an astronomical fitting code that utilizes Multi-
Gaussian Expansion, to carry out our size measurements. When
compared to the extrapolation of rest-optical size-mass
relations for quiescent galaxies at lower redshift, eight out of
ten candidates in our sample (80%) are on average more compact
by \ensuremath∼40%. Seven out of ten candidates (70%)
exhibit rest-frame infrared sizes \ensuremath∼10%
smaller than rest-frame optical sizes, indicative of negative
color gradients. Two candidates (20%) have rest-frame infrared
sizes \ensuremath∼1.4× larger than rest-frame
optical sizes; one of these candidates exhibits signs of ongoing
or residual star formation, suggesting this galaxy may not be
fully quenched. The remaining candidate is unresolved in both
filters, which may indicate an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
Strikingly, we observe three of the most massive galaxies in the
sample
(log(M_\⋆\/M_\\ensuremathødot\) =
10.74 - 10.95) are extremely compact, with effective radii
\ensuremath∼0.7 kpc. Our results indicate that quiescent
galaxies may be more compact than previously anticipated beyond
z>3, even after correcting for potential color gradients. This
suggests that the size evolution of quiescent galaxies is
steeper than previously anticipated and our current
understanding is biased by the limited wavelength capabilities
of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the presence of negative
color gradients in quiescent galaxies.},
