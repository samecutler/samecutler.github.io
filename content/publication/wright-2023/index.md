abstract: In this letter, we measure the rest-frame optical and near-infrared sizes
  of ten quiescent candidates at 3<z<5, first reported by Carnell et al. (2023a).
  We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) F277W and
  F444W imaging obtained through the public CEERS Early Release Science (ERS) program
  and imcascade, an astronomical fitting code that utilizes Multi-Gaussian Expansion,
  to carry out our size measurements. When compared to the extrapolation of rest-optical
  size-mass relations for quiescent galaxies at lower redshift, eight out of ten candidates
  in our sample (80%) are on average more compact by ∼40%. Seven out of ten candidates
  (70%) exhibit rest-frame infrared sizes ∼10% smaller than rest-frame optical sizes,
  indicative of negative color gradients. Two candidates (20%) have rest-frame infrared
  sizes ∼1.4× larger than rest-frame optical sizes; one of these candidates exhibits
  signs of ongoing or residual star formation, suggesting this galaxy may not be fully
  quenched. The remaining candidate is unresolved in both filters, which may indicate
  an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Strikingly, we observe three of the most massive
  galaxies in the sample (log(M_/M_⊙) = 10.74 - 10.95) are extremely compact, with
  effective radii ∼0.7 kpc. Our results indicate that quiescent galaxies may be more
  compact than previously anticipated beyond z>3, even after correcting for potential
  color gradients. This suggests that the size evolution of quiescent galaxies is
  steeper than previously anticipated and our current understanding is biased by the
  limited wavelength capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the presence
  of negative color gradients in quiescent galaxies.
