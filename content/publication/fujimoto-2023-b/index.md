abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies
  at zrsim9 found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle
  1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the
  Lyα break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to M_ UV=-17.3. We achieve
  a high confirmation rate of 100% for z>9 candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023).
  Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset
  of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Lyα break alone with prism can
  be as large as ±0.2, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy
  for the break-only sources. With spec-z confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature,
  we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF)
  at z≃9-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements.
  We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus
  (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) Hβ, high ionization line
  (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN
  LFs at z≃ 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at
  z∼6 and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of z>9 galaxies claimed
  in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at
  the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at z=8.50 with a physical separation of 380
  kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Lyα line or continuum emission,
  suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of 7.69±0.18
  pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.
