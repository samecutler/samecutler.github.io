abstract: While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local
  populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle
  has not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational limitations.
  We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass galaxies (M_⋆ <
  10^9.5,M_⊙) at cosmic noon (1<z<3), uniformly selected on F200W magnitude and precise
  photometric redshifts enabled by 20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience
  surveys. The spectra reveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively
  correlated with the galaxies' Hα equivalent width. By comparing these observations
  to synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty
  star formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at cosmic
  noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales (rsim 100 Myr) and
  large deviations below the star-forming main sequence (rsim 0.8 dex). Our results
  suggest that galaxies in this population --at least those within our detection limits--should
  not be classified solely by their current star formation rates, but instead viewed
  as a unified population undergoing dynamic movement above and below the star-forming
  main sequence. The derived constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations
  are important for this class of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather
  than molecular-cloud-scale stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star formation
  variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.
