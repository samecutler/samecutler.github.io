 abstract = {While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in
local populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant
phase of the burst cycle has not been well studied beyond the
local Universe due to observational limitations. We present a
unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass galaxies
($M_⋆ < 10^9.5\,M_ødot$) at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$),
uniformly selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric
redshifts enabled by 20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER
and MegaScience surveys. The spectra reveal numerous strong
Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the
galaxies' H$α$ equivalent width. By comparing these observations
to synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple
parametrization of bursty star formation histories, we show that
star formation in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon is likely
dominated by burst cycles with long timescales ($rsim 100$ Myr)
and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence ($rsim
0.8$ dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population
--at least those within our detection limits--should not be
classified solely by their current star formation rates, but
instead viewed as a unified population undergoing dynamic
movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The
derived constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations
are important for this class of galaxies, indicating that
galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather than molecular-cloud-scale
stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star formation
variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.},
