 abstract = {We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm log
(M_*/M_Ã¸dot) > 10.3 $) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using
JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from
RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an
unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer
physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent
galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component
analysis and construct a final sample using star formation
histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the
NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the
RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness
and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies
at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic
estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early
massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($rsim
10^-5$ Mpc$^-3$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with
previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in
smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with
predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy
formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to
produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the
treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient
formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.},
