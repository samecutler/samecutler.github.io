abstract: We present the number density of massive ( mathlog (M_*/M_âŠ™) > 10.3 ) quiescent
  galaxies at 2<z<5 using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra
  from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined
  targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We
  identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis
  and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric
  fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES
  selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number
  density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete
  spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive
  quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common (rsim 10^-5 Mpc^-3 by 4<z<5), which is
  consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller
  survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art
  cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At z>3, most simulations fail to produce
  enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the
  channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.
