 abstract = {Dusty star-forming galaxies have long been suspected to serve as the
missing evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and
quiescent phases of massive galaxy evolution. With the combined
power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible to use high
resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR),
and rest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength
morphologies tracing both the stellar populations and dust
within this key phase. We present the joint analysis of
JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by
ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected
from the 1.1mm GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the
morphologies of this population to mass and redshift selected
samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-
selected sample are morphologically distinct from other
similarly massive star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-
wavelength gradient from 1.5-4.4$Î¼$m, with a more dramatic
decrease in size towards longer wavelengths. While the rest-NIR
surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are
brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming
population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent
population. These morphological differences could suggest that
dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming
galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-
obscured core, leading to extended and clumpy morphologies at
rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in the rest-
NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already
established, we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may
imminently evolve to join their quiescent descendants.},
