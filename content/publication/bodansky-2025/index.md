abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies have long been suspected to serve as the missing
  evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and quiescent phases of massive galaxy
  evolution. With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible to use high
  resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and rest-submm wavelengths
  to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both the stellar populations
  and dust within this key phase. We present the joint analysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging
  in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at z=1.5
  to z=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies
  of this population to mass and redshift selected samples of field star-forming and
  quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from
  other similarly massive star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength
  gradient from 1.5-4.4Î¼m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer wavelengths.
  While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are
  brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming population, they
  are remarkably similar to the quiescent population. These morphological differences
  could suggest that dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming
  galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading
  to extended and clumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact
  emission in the rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established,
  we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their quiescent
  descendants.
