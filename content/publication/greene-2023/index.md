abstract: 'JWST is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic
  nuclei (AGN) at redshifts zrsim5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy
  from the Cycle 1 Treasury program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact,
  with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From
  NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation
  or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are
  dust-reddened AGN: 60% show definitive evidence for broad-line Hα with FWHM>2000
  km/s, for 20% current data are inconclusive, and 20% are brown dwarf stars. We propose
  an updated photometric criterion to select red z>5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs
  and is expected to yield >80% AGN. Remarkably, among all z_phot>5 galaxies with
  F277W-F444W>1 in UNCOVER at least 33% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing
  to at least 80% AGN for sources with F277W-F444W>1.6. The confirmed AGN have black
  hole masses of 10^7-10^9 M_⊙. While their UV-luminosities (-16>M_UV>-20 AB mag)
  are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level
  scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric
  luminosities are typical of 10^7-10^9 M_⊙ black holes radiating at ∼ 10-40% of Eddington.
  The number densities are surprisingly high at ∼10^-5 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, 100 times more
  common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ∼1% of the UV-selected
  galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not contribute strongly to reionization,
  their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.'
