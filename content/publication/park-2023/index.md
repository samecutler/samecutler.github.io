abstract: The existence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift seems to require
  rapid quenching, but it is unclear whether all quiescent galaxies have gone through
  this phase and what physical mechanisms are involved. To study rapid quenching,
  we use rest-frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at z~1.5. From spectral
  energy distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense starbursts
  prior to rapid quenching. We confirm this with deep Magellan/FIRE spectroscopic
  observations for a subset of seven galaxies. Broad emission lines are detected for
  two galaxies, and are most likely caused by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity.
  The other five galaxies do not show any emission features, suggesting that gas has
  already been removed or depleted. Most of the rapidly quenched galaxies are more
  compact than normal quiescent galaxies, providing evidence for a central starburst
  in the recent past. We estimate an average transition time of 300 Myr for the rapid
  quenching phase. Approximately 4% of quiescent galaxies at z = 1.5 have gone through
  rapid quenching; this fraction increases to 23% at z = 2.2. We identify analogs
  in the TNG100 simulation and find that rapid quenching for these galaxies is driven
  by AGNs, and for half of the cases, gas-rich major mergers seem to trigger the starburst.
  We conclude that these young massive quiescent galaxies are not just rapidly quenched,
  but also rapidly formed through a major starburst. We speculate that mergers drive
  gas inflow toward the central regions and grow supermassive black holes, leading
  to rapid quenching by AGN feedback.
