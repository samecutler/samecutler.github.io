abstract: We present a F160W morphological catalog for the COSMOS-DASH survey, the
  largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing the “Drift And SHift”
  (DASH) observing technique for NIR imaging, in which guide star acquisition is only
  done once per orbit and instrument drift is corrected in post processing, the COSMOS-DASH
  survey imaged approximately 0.7 square degrees of the UltraVISTA deep stripes. Global
  structural parameters are measured for about 50,000 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH
  using GALFIT, with detection using a deep combined optical and near-infrared noise-equalized
  HST image. While the shallower depth of DASH observations and the non-standard data
  reduction techniques may not be ideal for low-mass or extended galaxies, we recover
  consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs out
  to z=2 and log(M/Msun)~10. As the DASH technique limits each pointing to an exposure
  time of~300 seconds, the corresponding images are shallower than usual HST NIR imaging
  with 5-sigma depths of 25.1 ABmag. Here we test the parameter space where morphological
  fits of DASH galaxies are robustly recovered. In general, sizes and Sérsic indices
  of typical galaxies are accurately obtained for H(160)<23 and H(160)<22. In size-mass
  parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphologies in general
  below redshift 2 and log(M/Msun)>9. At log(M/Msun)<10.5, we find a flattening of
  the quiescent size-mass relation, implying the sizes of low mass quiescent galaxies
  are more similar to star-forming galaxies with a similar redshift and mass. Trends
  with axis-ratio and environment suggest that low mass galaxies that quench as satellites
  may retain morphologies comparable to similar mass star-forming galaxies.
