abstract: We present a F160W morphological catalog for the COSMOS-DASH survey, the
  largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing the ``Drift And SHift''
  (DASH) observing technique for NIR imaging, in which guide star acquisition is only
  done once per orbit and instrument drift is corrected in post processing, the COSMOS-DASH
  survey imaged approximately 0.7 square degrees of the UltraVISTA deep stripes. Global
  structural parameters are measured for about 50,000 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH
  using GALFIT, with detection using a deep combined optical and near-infrared noise-equalized
  HST image. While the shallower depth of DASH observations and the non-standard data
  reduction techniques may not be ideal for low-mass or extended galaxies, we recover
  consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs out
  to z=2 and log(M/Msun)~10. As the DASH technique limits each pointing to an exposure
  time of ~300 seconds, the corresponding images are shallower than usual HST NIR
  imaging with 5-sigma depths of 25.1 ABmag. Here we test the parameter space where
  morphological fits of DASH galaxies are robustly recovered. In general, sizes and
  SÃ©rsic indices of typical galaxies are accurately obtained for H(160)<23 and H(160)<22.
  In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphologies
  in general below redshift 2 and log(M/Msun)>9. At log(M/Msun)<10.5, we find a flattening
  of the quiescent size-mass relation, implying the sizes of low mass quiescent galaxies
  are more similar to star-forming galaxies with a similar redshift and mass. Trends
  with axis-ratio and environment suggest that low mass galaxies that quench as satellites
  may retain morphologies comparable to similar mass star-forming galaxies.
