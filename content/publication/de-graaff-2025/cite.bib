 abstract = {Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start
as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more
massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first
billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent
observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies
would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars.
An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of
massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars.
However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies
have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of
photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic
confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the
quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z = 4.90, 1.2
billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption
features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the
galaxy of 10$^11$ M$_\ensuremathødot$ formed in a
short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star
formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According
to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid
stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to
plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with
JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that
early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or
exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than
assumed at present.},
