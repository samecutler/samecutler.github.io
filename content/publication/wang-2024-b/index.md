abstract: 'The recent UNCOVER survey with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exploits
  the nearby cluster A2744 to create the deepest view of our Universe to date by leveraging
  strong gravitational lensing. In this work, we perfophotometric fitting of more
  than 50,000 robustly detected sources out to z ~ 15. We show the redshift evolution
  of stellar ages, star formation rates, and rest-frame colors across the full range
  of 0.2 lesssim z lesssim 15. The galaxy properties are inferred using the Prospector
  Bayesian inference framework using informative Prospector-β priors on the masses
  and star formation histories to produce joint redshift and stellar populations posteriors.
  Additionally, lensing magnification is performed on the fly to ensure consistency
  with the scale-dependent priors. We show that this approach produces excellent photometric
  redshifts with σ_NMAD ~ 0.03, of a similar quality to the established photometric
  redshift code EAzY. In line with the open-source scientific objective of this Treasury
  survey, we publicly release the stellar population catalog with this paper, derived
  from our photometric catalog adapting aperture sizes based on source profiles. This
  release (the catalog and all related documentation are accessible via the UNCOVER
  survey web page: https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR2.html#SPSCatalogs with a copy
  deposited to Zenodo at doi:10.5281/zenodo.8401181) includes posterior moments, maximum
  likelihood spectra, star formation histories, and full posterior distributions,
  offering a rich data set to explore the processes governing galaxy formation and
  evolution over a parameter space now accessible by JWST.'
