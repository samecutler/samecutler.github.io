abstract: The identification of sources driving cosmic reionization, a major phase
  transition from neutral hydrogen to ionized plasma around 600-800 Myr after the
  Big Bang^1-3, has been a matter of debate^4. Some models suggest that high ionizing
  emissivity and escape fractions (f_esc) from quasars support their role in driving
  cosmic reionization^5,6. Others propose that the high f_esc values from bright galaxies
  generate sufficient ionizing radiation to drive this process^7. Finally, a few studies
  suggest that the number density of faint galaxies, when combined with a stellar-mass-dependent
  model of ionizing efficiency and f_esc, can effectively dominate cosmic reionization^8,9.
  However, so far, comprehensive spectroscopic studies of low-mass galaxies have not
  been done because of their extreme faintness. Here we report an analysis of eight
  ultra-faint galaxies (in a very small field) during the epoch of reionization with
  absolute magnitudes between M_UV ≈ -17 mag and -15 mag (down to 0.005L^⋆ (refs.
  ^10,11)). We find that faint galaxies during the first thousand million years of
  the Universe produce ionizing photons with log[ξ_ion (Hz erg^-1)] = 25.80 ± 0.14,
  a factor of 4 higher than commonly assumed values^12. If this field is representative
  of the large-scale distribution of faint galaxies, the rate of ionizing photons
  exceeds that needed for reionization, even for escape fractions of the order of
  5%.
