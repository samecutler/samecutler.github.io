abstract: We present the design and observations of low-resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM
  spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch
  of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using
  JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of
  categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories
  include the first galaxies at z gtrsim 10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization
  (z ∼ 6‑8), high-redshift active galactic nuclei (z gtrsim 6), Population III star
  candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1 lesssim z lesssim 6), and filler
  galaxies sampling redshift–color–magnitude space from z ∼ 0.1‑13. Seven NIRSpec
  microshutter array masks across the extended A2744 cluster were observed, along
  with NIRCam parallel imaging in nine filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W,
  F356W, F410M, F444W, and F480M) over a total area of ∼26 arcmin^2, overlapping existing
  Hubble Space Telescope coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields
  and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_F444W ∼ 30 AB, and by
  leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4
  to 16.7 hr. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of the confirmed redshifts,
  and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for
  a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of A2744 is also presented, including
  14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_SL =
  (2.1 ± 0.3) × 10^15 M_⊙. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects
  observed in summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated
  lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).
