 abstract = {We present the design and observations of low-resolution JWST/NIRSpec
PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam
ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1
JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam
photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide
range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of
the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z
\ensuremath\gtrsim 10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of
Reionization (z \ensuremath∼ 6‑8), high-redshift active
galactic nuclei (z \ensuremath\gtrsim 6), Population III
star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1
\ensuremathłesssim z \ensuremathłesssim 6), and filler
galaxies sampling
redshift–color–magnitude space from z
\ensuremath∼ 0.1‑13. Seven NIRSpec microshutter array
masks across the extended A2744 cluster were observed, along
with NIRCam parallel imaging in nine filters (F090W, F115W,
F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, and F480M) over a
total area of \ensuremath∼26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping
existing Hubble Space Telescope coverage from programs including
the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed
553 objects down to m$_F444W$ \ensuremath∼ 30 AB, and
by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure
times ranging from 2.4 to 16.7 hr. We demonstrate the success
rate and distribution of the confirmed redshifts, and also
highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep
spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of
A2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic
redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M$_SL$ = (2.1
\ensuremath± 0.3) × 10$^15$
M$_\ensuremathødot$. We publicly release reduced 1D and
2D spectra for all objects observed in summer 2023 along with a
spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the
cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).},
