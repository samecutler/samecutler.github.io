abstract: JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects
  at high redshifts dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs), which typically show broad
  emission lines and are thought to be dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some of
  their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent
  Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray,
  or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another robust
  test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z = 7.045 multiply imaged LRD A2744-QSO1,
  which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time
  delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate
  its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs)
  of the broad Hα and Hβ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics,
  to exhibit significant variations, of up to 18 ± 3% for Hα and up to 22 ± 8% in
  Hβ, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1
  is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting
  systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations
  are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with
  a typical damped random walk variability model for an AGN such as A2744-QSO1 (M_BH
  = 4 × 10^7 M_⊙) given the sparse sampling of the light curve with the available
  data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight
  the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build
  a detailed and reliable light curve.
