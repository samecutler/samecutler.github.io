 abstract = {JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact
objects at high redshifts dubbed ``little red dots'' (LRDs),
which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be
dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some of their other
features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as
prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing
metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including
in deep stacks. Time variability is another robust test of AGN
activity. Here, we exploit the z = 7.045 multiply imaged LRD
A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of
variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three
images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate
its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the
equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H\ensuremathα and
H\ensuremathβ lines, which are independent of
magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant
variations, of up to 18 \ensuremath± 3% for
H\ensuremathα and up to 22 \ensuremath± 8% in
H\ensuremathβ, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the
rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We
find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting
systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined
whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum
variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped
random walk variability model for an AGN such as A2744-QSO1
(M$_BH$ = 4 × 10$^7$
M$_\ensuremathødot$) given the sparse sampling of the
light curve with the available data. Our results therefore
support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the
need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in
order to build a detailed and reliable light curve.},
