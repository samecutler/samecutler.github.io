abstract: "We present the H $_160$ morphological catalogs for the COSMOS-DASH survey, the largest area near-IR survey using HST-WFC3 to date. Utilizing the ``Drift And SHift'' observing technique for HST- WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5 deg$^2$ of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 deg$^2$, when combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi- band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in general, sizes and Sérsic indices of typical galaxies are accurate to limiting magnitudes of H $_160$ < 23 and H $_160$ < 22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological measurements out to z åisebox-0.5ex~ 2 and down to $mathrmlog(M_⋆ /M_ødot )∼ 9$ . With the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below $mathrmlog(M_⋆ /M_ødot )∼ 10.5$ that persists out to z i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 2. We show that environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to z = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural evolution."
