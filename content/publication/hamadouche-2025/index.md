abstract: We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass
  function (GSMF), size–mass relations, and morphological properties of star-forming
  and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range , using the JWST PRIMER survey. The
  depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confithe double Schechter function
  shape of the quiescent GSMF out to , via a clear detection of the upturn at  thought
  to be induced by environmental quenching. Additionally, we confithat quiescent galaxies
  can be split into separate populations at , based on their size–mass relations and
  morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disc-like morphologies
  (based on Sérsic index, Gini coefficient, and metrics) and follow a shallower size–mass
  relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size–mass relation
  followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed
  by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the
  errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies ( is indistinguishable
  from that followed by star-forming galaxies, and significantly less rapid than that
  displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies (. Overall, our results are consistent
  with low- and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways.
  The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the
  expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping).
  In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass
  quenching (e.g. active galactic nucleus feedback) followed by size growth driven
  by minor mergers.
