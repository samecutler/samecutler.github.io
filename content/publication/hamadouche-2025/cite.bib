 abstract = {We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass
function (GSMF), size–mass relations, and
morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies
over the redshift range , using the JWST PRIMER survey. The
depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the
double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to ,
via a clear detection of the upturn at  thought to be induced by
environmental quenching. Additionally, we confirm that quiescent
galaxies can be split into separate populations at , based on
their size–mass relations and morphologies. We find
that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disc-like
morphologies (based on Sérsic index, Gini coefficient, and
metrics) and follow a shallower size–mass relation
than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the
size–mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent
galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming
galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within
the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass
quiescent galaxies ( is indistinguishable from that followed by
star-forming galaxies, and significantly less rapid than that
displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies (. Overall, our
results are consistent with low- and high-mass quiescent
galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution
of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with
the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-
pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass
quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching
(e.g. active galactic nucleus feedback) followed by size growth
driven by minor mergers.},
