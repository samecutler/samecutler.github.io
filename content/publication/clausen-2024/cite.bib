 abstract = {We present a study of the growth of the quiescent galaxy population
between 0.5 < z < 3 by tracing the number density and structural
evolution of a sample of 4518 old and 583 young quiescent
galaxies with log(M $_\ensuremath⋆$/M
$_\ensuremathødot$) > 10.4, selected from the COSMOS2020
catalog with complementary Hubble Space Telescope F160W imaging
from the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z
\ensuremath∼ 2, roughly 50% are recently quenched
galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly
rare toward lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak
epoch of massive galaxy quenching occurred at z > 2. Our data
show that while the effective half-light radius of quiescent
galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies
are significantly smaller than their older counterparts at the
same redshift. In this work we investigate the connection
between this size difference and other structural properties,
including axis ratio, color gradients, stellar mass, and the
intrinsic scatter in effective radius. We demonstrate that the
size difference is driven by the most massive subpopulation
(log(M $_\ensuremath⋆$/M $_\ensuremathødot$) >
11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to
intermediate-mass galaxies (10.4 < log(M
$_\ensuremath⋆$/M $_\ensuremathødot$) < 11).
Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical size shows a
strong coevolution over the investigated time period and peaks
around z \ensuremath∼ 2 for both populations, only
diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and assuming we are not
missing a significant population of lower surface brightness
galaxies, while the formation and quenching mechanisms that
dominate at higher redshifts yield compact remnants, multiple
evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies of
galaxies that quench at z < 1.},
