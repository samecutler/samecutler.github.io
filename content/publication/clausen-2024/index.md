abstract: We present a study of the growth of the quiescent galaxy population between
  0.5 < z < 3 by tracing the number density and structural evolution of a sample of
  4518 old and 583 young quiescent galaxies with log(M_⋆/M_⊙) > 10.4, selected from
  the COSMOS2020 catalog with complementary Hubble Space Telescope F160W imaging from
  the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z ∼ 2, roughly 50% are recently
  quenched galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly rare toward
  lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak epoch of massive galaxy quenching
  occurred at z > 2. Our data show that while the effective half-light radius of quiescent
  galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies are significantly
  smaller than their older counterparts at the same redshift. In this work we investigate
  the connection between this size difference and other structural properties, including
  axis ratio, color gradients, stellar mass, and the intrinsic scatter in effective
  radius. We demonstrate that the size difference is driven by the most massive subpopulation
  (log(M_⋆/M_⊙) > 11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to intermediate-mass
  galaxies (10.4 < log(M_⋆/M_⊙) < 11). Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical
  size shows a strong coevolution over the investigated time period and peaks around
  z ∼ 2 for both populations, only diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and assuming
  we are not missing a significant population of lower surface brightness galaxies,
  while the formation and quenching mechanisms that dominate at higher redshifts yield
  compact remnants, multiple evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies
  of galaxies that quench at z < 1.
