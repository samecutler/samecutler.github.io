abstract: In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and
  NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury
  program, which executed its early imaging component in November 2022. The UNCOVER
  survey includes ultradeep (∼29-30AB) imaging of ∼45 arcmin^2 on and around the well-studied
  Abell 2744 galaxy cluster at z=0.308 and will follow-up ∼500 galaxies with extremely
  deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023.
  We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data
  releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging
  mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2-4 micron imaging
  of known objects in the field. The UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin^2
  in seven filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W) and 16.8 arcmin^2
  in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early
  community use of the Treasury data set, we publicly release full reduced mosaics
  of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin^2 NIRCam and 17 arcmin^2 NIRISS mosaics
  on and around the Abell 2744 cluster, including the Hubble Frontier Field primary
  and parallel footprints.
