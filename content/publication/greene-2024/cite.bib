 abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope is revealing a new population of dust-
reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z
\ensuremath\gtrsim 5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism
spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec
and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization
(UNCOVER) of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red
continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the
UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated
by dusty star formation or an AGN. Here we show that the
majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened
AGN: 60% show definitive evidence for broad-line
H\ensuremathα with a FWHM > 2000 km s $^‑1$, 20% of
the current data are inconclusive, and 20% are brown dwarf
stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red
z > 5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield
>80% AGN. Remarkably, among all z $_phot$ > 5 galaxies with
F277W – F444W > 1 in UNCOVER at least 33% are AGN
regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80% AGN for
sources with F277W – F444W > 1.6. The confirmed AGN
have black hole masses of 10$^7$–10$^9$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$. While their UV luminosities (‑16 > M
$_UV$ > ‑20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at
these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light
or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred
bolometric luminosities are typical of
10$^7$–10$^9$ M $_\ensuremathødot$
black holes radiating at
\ensuremath∼10%–40% the Eddington limit.
The number densities are surprisingly high at
\ensuremath∼10$^‑5$ Mpc$^‑3$ mag$^‑1$, 100 times
more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while
accounting for \ensuremath∼1% of the UV-selected
galaxies. While their UV faintness suggests they may not
contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses
challenges to models of black hole growth.},
