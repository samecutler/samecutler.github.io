abstract: 'The James Webb Space Telescope is revealing a new population of dust-reddened
  broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z gtrsim 5. Here we present
  deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec
  and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) of 15 AGN candidates
  selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue
  slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by
  dusty star formation or an AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red
  sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60% show definitive evidence for broad-line
  Hα with a FWHM > 2000 km s ^‑1, 20% of the current data are inconclusive, and 20%
  are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red
  z > 5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield >80% AGN. Remarkably,
  among all z_phot > 5 galaxies with F277W – F444W > 1 in UNCOVER at least 33% are
  AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80% AGN for sources with F277W
  – F444W > 1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 10^7–10^9 M_⊙. While
  their UV luminosities (‑16 > M_UV > ‑20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected
  AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels
  of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of
  10^7–10^9 M_⊙ black holes radiating at ∼10%–40% the Eddington limit. The number
  densities are surprisingly high at ∼10^‑5 Mpc^‑3 mag^‑1, 100 times more common than
  the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ∼1% of the UV-selected galaxies.
  While their UV faintness suggests they may not contribute strongly to reionization,
  their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.'
