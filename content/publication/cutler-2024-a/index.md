abstract: 'We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size–mass relation at
  cosmic noon (1 < z < 3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury surveys, which
  highlights two distinct classes of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population
  is well studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously underexplored
  due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution.
  We select a conservative sample of low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates using rest-frame
  UVJ colors and specific star formation rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology
  in both rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared (F444W).
  We confirm an unambiguous flattening of the low-mass quiescent size–mass relation,
  which results from the separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct
  populations at log(M_⋆/M_⊙)∼ 10.3 : low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably
  younger and have disky structures, and massive galaxies consistent with spheroidal
  morphologies and older median stellar ages. These separate populations imply mass
  quenching dominates at the massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental
  or feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar mass-dependent
  slope of the quiescent size–mass relation could also indicate a shift from size
  growth due to star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive galaxies).
  The transition mass between these two populations also corresponds with other dramatic
  changes and characteristic masses in several galaxy evolution scaling relations
  (e.g., star formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-to-halo mass ratios),
  further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy formation.'
