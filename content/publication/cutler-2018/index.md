abstract: Examination of galactic rotation curves in the local universe has yielded
  evidence of both cusp and core type dark matter profiles. We present one of the
  first studies of a galactic rotation curve for a distant gravitationally-lensed
  massive, dusty star-forming galaxy, CL2244-1, with a spectroscopic redshift 1.77.
  Using VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopy, we perfoa 2D spectral analysis of the H-alpha emission.
  With this rotation curve, we fit a dark matter density profile and determine the
  functional foof the profile (cusp or core). Predictions from comparing the shape
  of the rotation curve of CL2244-1 to that of M33 and other galaxies in the local
  universe suggest that the dark matter profile of CL2244-1 is best represented by
  a cuspy profile. Though this cuspy profile supports the cold dark matter cosmological
  model, we cannot rule out self-interacting dark matter, whose interactions may not
  have had time to shift the density profile to a core at such early times.
