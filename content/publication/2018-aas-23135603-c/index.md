abstract: "Examination of galactic rotation curves in the local universe has yielded evidence of both cusp and core type dark matter profiles. We present one of the first studies of a galactic rotation curve for a distant gravitationally-lensed massive, dusty star-forming galaxy, CL2244-1, with a spectroscopic redshift 1.77. Using VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopy, we perform a 2D spectral analysis of the H-alpha emission. With this rotation curve, we fit a dark matter density profile and determine the functional form of the profile (cusp or core). Predictions from comparing the shape of the rotation curve of CL2244-1 to that of M33 and other galaxies in the local universe suggest that the dark matter profile of CL2244-1 is best represented by a cuspy profile. Though this cuspy profile supports the cold dark matter cosmological model, we cannot rule out self-interacting dark matter, whose interactions may not have had time to shift the density profile to a core at such early times."
