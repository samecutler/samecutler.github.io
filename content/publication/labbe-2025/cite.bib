 abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge
of z > 5 galaxies and their actively accreting black holes.
Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and
NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER)
in the lensing field A2744, we report the identification of a
sample of little red dots at 3 < z $_phot$ < 7 that likely
contain highly reddened accreting supermassive black holes.
Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W < 27.7 mag, we find 26
sources over the \ensuremath∼45 arcmin$^2$ field that
are blue in F115W ‑ F200W \ensuremath∼ 0 (or
\ensuremathβ $_UV$ \ensuremath∼
–2.0 for f $_ \ensuremathłambda $
\ensuremath∝ \ensuremathłambda $^
\ensuremathβ $), red in F200W ‑ F444W = 1‑4
(\ensuremathβ $_opt$ \ensuremath∼ +2.0), and
are dominated by a point-source-like central component. Of the
20 sources with deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm coverage, none are detected individually or
in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy
distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models
with hot dust rather than obscured star formation to reproduce
the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm nondetections. While
compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the
combination of extremely small sizes (<r $_ e $>
\ensuremath≈ 50 pc after correction for
magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can
be explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). Our targets have faint M $_1450$
\ensuremath≈ ‑14 to ‑18 mag but inferred bolometric
luminosities of L $_bol$ = 10$^43$–10$^46$
erg s$^‑1$, reflecting their obscured nature. If the
candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER
spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of
reddened luminous AGNs that are at least ten times more numerous
than UV-luminous AGNs at the same intrinsic bolometric
luminosity.},
