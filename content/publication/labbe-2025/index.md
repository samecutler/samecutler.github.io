abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge of
  z > 5 galaxies and their actively accreting black holes. Using the JWST Cycle 1
  Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization
  (UNCOVER) in the lensing field A2744, we report the identification of a sample of
  little red dots at 3 < z_phot < 7 that likely contain highly reddened accreting
  supermassive black holes. Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W < 27.7 mag, we
  find 26 sources over the ∼45 arcmin^2 field that are blue in F115W ‑ F200W ∼ 0 (or
  β_UV ∼ –2.0 for f_ lambda  ∝ lambda ^ β ), red in F200W ‑ F444W = 1‑4 (β_opt ∼ +2.0),
  and are dominated by a point-source-like central component. Of the 20 sources with
  deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm coverage, none are
  detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy
  distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather
  than obscured star formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm
  nondetections. While compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the combination
  of extremely small sizes (<r_ e > ≈ 50 pc after correction for magnification), red
  rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can be explained by reddened broad-line
  active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our targets have faint M_1450 ≈ ‑14 to ‑18 mag but
  inferred bolometric luminosities of L_bol = 10^43–10^46 erg s^‑1, reflecting their
  obscured nature. If the candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy,
  then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGNs that are at
  least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGNs at the same intrinsic bolometric
  luminosity.
