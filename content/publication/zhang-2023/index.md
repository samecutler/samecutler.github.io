abstract: We analyse the joint distribution of dust attenuation and projected axis
  ratios, together with galaxy size and surface brightness profile information, to
  infer lessons on the dust content and star/dust geometry within star-forming galaxies
  at 0 < z < 2.5. To do so, we make use of large observational data sets from KiDS
  + VIKING + HSC-SSP and extend the analysis out to redshift z = 2.5 using the HST
  surveys CANDELS and 3D-DASH. We construct suites of SKIRT radiative transfer models
  for idealized galaxies observed under random viewing angles with the aim of reproducing
  the aforementioned distributions, including the level and inclination dependence
  of dust attenuation. We find that attenuation-based dust mass estimates are at odds
  with constraints from far-infrared observations, especially at higher redshifts,
  when assuming smooth star and dust geometries of equal extent. We demonstrate that
  UV-to-near-IR and far-infrared constraints can be reconciled by invoking clumpier
  dust geometries for galaxies at higher redshifts and/or very compact dust cores.
  We discuss implications for the significant wavelength- and redshift-dependent differences
  between half-light and half-mass radii that result from spatially varying dust columns
  within especially massive star-forming galaxies.
