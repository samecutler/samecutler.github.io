abstract: In this Letter, we measure the rest-frame optical and near-infrared sizes
  of 10 quiescent candidates at 3 < z < 5, first reported by Carnall et al. We use
  James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera F277W and F444W imaging obtained
  through the public CEERS Early Release Science program and imcascade, an astronomical
  fitting code that utilizes multi-Gaussian expansion, to carry out our size measurements.
  When compared to the extrapolation of rest-optical size–mass relations for quiescent
  galaxies at lower redshift, 8 out of 10 candidates in our sample (80%) are on average
  more compact by ∼40%. A total of 7 out of 10 candidates (70%) exhibit rest-frame
  infrared sizes ∼10% smaller than rest-frame optical sizes, indicative of negative
  color gradients. Two candidates (20%) have rest-frame infrared sizes ∼1.4× larger
  than rest-frame optical sizes; one of these candidates exhibits signs of ongoing
  or residual star formation, suggesting this galaxy may not be fully quenched. The
  remaining candidate is unresolved in both filters, which may indicate an active
  galactic nucleus. Strikingly, we observe three of the most massive galaxies in the
  sample (log(M_⋆/M_⊙) = 10.74–10.95) are extremely compact, with effective radii
  ∼0.7 kpc. Our findings provide no indication that the size evolution relation flattens
  out, and may indicate that the size evolution of quiescent galaxies is steeper than
  previously anticipated beyond z > 3.
