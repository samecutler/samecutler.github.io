abstract: We present the survey design and initial results of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
  Array (ALMA) Cycle 9 program of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and
  JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster A2744. DUALZ features
  a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30 GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of μ > 2 down
  to a sensitivity of σ = 32.7 μJy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust
  continuum sources at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gtrsim 5.0 with median redshift
  and intrinsic 1.2 mm flux of z = 2.30 and S1.2mmint=0.24 mJy. Of these, 27 have
  been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations,
  while photometric redshifts are also constrained by the comprehensive Hubble Space
  Telescope (HST), NIRCam, and ALMA data sets for the remaining sources. With priors,
  we further identify a [C II]158 μm line emitter at z = 6.3254 ± 0.0004, confirmed
  by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2 mm continuum
  exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the
  triggers for the faint millimeter emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We
  have identified eight HST-dark galaxies (F150W > 27 mag, F150W ‑ F444W > 2.3) and
  two JWST-dark (F444W > 30 mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources.
  The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration
  does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission
  from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z_spec = 10.07, suggesting an active coevolution
  of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function
  up to z ∼ 10 and find it is consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models.
  To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced
  ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog at https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR2.html#DUALZ.
