 abstract = {We present the survey design and initial results of the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 9 program of DUALZ,
which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy
field targeting the massive galaxy cluster A2744. DUALZ features
a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30 GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6,
covering areas of \ensuremathμ > 2 down to a sensitivity
of \ensuremathσ = 32.7 \ensuremathμJy. Through a
blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \ensuremath\gtrsim 5.0 with
median redshift and intrinsic 1.2 mm flux of z = 2.30 and
S1.2mmint=0.24 mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically
confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while
photometric redshifts are also constrained by the comprehensive
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), NIRCam, and ALMA data sets for the
remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [C II]158
\ensuremathμm line emitter at z = 6.3254
\ensuremath± 0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec
spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2 mm continuum
exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or
spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint millimeter
emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified
eight HST-dark galaxies (F150W > 27 mag, F150W ‑ F444W > 2.3)
and two JWST-dark (F444W > 30 mag) galaxy candidates among the
ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk
galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not
always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust
emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z$_spec$ = 10.07,
suggesting an active coevolution of the central black hole and
its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z
\ensuremath∼ 10 and find it is consistent with
predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse
scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release
reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog at
