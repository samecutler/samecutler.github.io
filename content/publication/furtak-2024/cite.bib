 abstract = {{Early JWST observations have uncovered a population of red sources that
might represent a previously overlooked phase of supermassive
black hole growth$^{1-3}$. One of the most intriguing examples
is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be
triply imaged by the strong lensing cluster Abell 2744 (ref.
$^{4}$). Here we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this
object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three
images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened
(A$_{V}$ â‰ƒ 3) broad emission line active galactic nucleus at a
redshift of z$_{spec}$ = 7.0451 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0005. From
the width of H{\ensuremath{\beta}} (full width at half-maximum =
2,800 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 250 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$), we
derive a black hole mass of
M$_{BH}$=4$_{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$$^{+2}${\texttimes}1
{}0$^{7}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ . We infer a very high ratio
of black-hole-to-galaxy mass of at least 3\%, an order of
magnitude more than that seen in local galaxies$^{5}$ and
possibly as high as 100\%. The lack of strong metal lines in the
spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (L$_{bol}$
= (1.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3) {\texttimes} {}10$^{45}$ erg
s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$) indicate that we are seeing the black
hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30\% of the
Eddington limit. The rapid growth and high black-hole-to-galaxy
mass ratio of Abell2744-QSO1 suggest that it may represent the
missing link between black hole seeds$^{6}$ and one of the first
luminous quasars$^{7}$.}},
