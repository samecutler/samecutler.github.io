I am an Astronomy Postdoctoral Researcher at Tufts University with the JWST Cycle 4 MINERVA team.  I obtained my Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in September 2025 advised by Kate Whitaker. I graduated with a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Connecticut in 2019. In my research, I focus on the formation and evolution of galaxies via large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and galaxy morphology.

In the past, I have studied the relationship between galaxy structure, environment, and star formation through the creation of the [COSMOS-DASH morphological catalog](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/cosmos-dash). I have also investigated the different formation histories of the inner and outer parts of typical star-forming galaxies near cosmic noon using the [*Prospector*](https://prospect.readthedocs.io) code. Recently, I have been working with photometry and source detection in HST (3D-DASH) and JWST (PRIMER and UNCOVER) surveys, assisting in the creation and development of the [*aperpy* aperture photometry code](https://github.com/astrowhit/aperpy) and photometric catalogs for each of these programs. Using the rich JWST data from [PRIMER](https://primer-jwst.github.io) and [UNCOVER](https://jwst-uncover.github.io), I have investigated the formation of low-mass quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon via morphological analyses in NIRCam F150W and F444W and extended this analysis to low-mass quiescent galaxies in the Abell 2744 lensing cluster.

I am a PI of "The Relic", a JWST Cycle 3 program targeting a z~2.5 massive quiescent galaxy containing several resolved globular cluster candidates with deep (>20 hr) NIRSpec/IFU prism spectroscopy. I am also the photometric catalog lead for the JWST Cycle 4 MINERVA program, which covers four existing JWST datasets (COSMOS, UDS, GOODS-N, and CEERS) with additional photometry from several medium band filters.

Outside of research, I am an active member in science outreach with UMass Astronomy, where we hope to make science accessible to the larger community and encourage interest in astronomy, and worked to found the Western Massachusetts chapter of Astronomy on Tap.
