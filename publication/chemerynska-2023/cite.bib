 abstract = {Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking
distances up to $z ∼ 13$. The JWST UNCOVER (ultra-deep
NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before the epoch of
reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep multiwavelength
NIRCam imaging of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 over
$∼ 45$ arcmin$^2$ down to $∼ 29.5$ AB mag. Here, we
present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived
through lensing clusters at $9<z<12$. Using comprehensive end-
to-end simulations, we account for all lensing effects and
systematic uncertainties in deriving both the amplification
factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confirm the
intriguing excess of UV-bright galaxies ($M_UV < -20$ AB mag)
previously reported at $z>9$ in recent JWST studies. In
particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes better the
bright-end of the luminosity function compared to the classical
Schechter form. The number density of these bright galaxies is
10-100 times larger than theoretical predictions and previous
findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations.
Additionally, we measure a star formation rate density of
$h̊o_\ ̊SFR = 10^-2.64$ M$_ødot$ yr$^-1$ Mpc$^-3$
at these redshifts, which is 4 to 10 times higher than galaxy
formation models that assume a constant star formation
efficiency. Future wide-area surveys and accurate modeling of
lensing-assisted observations will reliably constrain both the
bright and the dim end of the UV luminosity function at $z>9$,
which will provide key benchmarks for galaxy formation models.},
