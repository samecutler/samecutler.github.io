 abstract = {Deep observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have
revealed an emerging population of red pointlike sources that
could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black
hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work, we present a
JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury
survey of a massive accreting black hole at z = 8.50 displaying
a clear broad-line component as inferred from the
H\ensuremathβ line with FWHM = 3439 \ensuremath±
413 km s$^-1$, typical of the broad-line region of an active
galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further
supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines,
and a point-source morphology. We compute a black hole mass of
$\mathrmlog_10(M_\mathrmBH/M_ødot )=8.17±
0.42$ and a bolometric luminosity of L $_bol$
åisebox-0.5ex~ 6.6 × 10$^45$
erg s$^-1$. These values imply that our object is accreting at
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~40% of the Eddington limit.
Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the
optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA,
indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of
$\mathrmlog_10(M_* /M_ødot ) 8.7$ , which would
lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at
least \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~30%. This is orders of
magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs but consistent with
recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding
suggests that a nonnegligible fraction of supermassive black
holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a
super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted
number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec
observations of larger samples will allow us to further
investigate galaxy-black hole coevolution in the early Universe.},
